<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>To explain the present undertaking, it should be mentioned
that a history of Hursley and North Baddesley was compiled by the
Reverend John Marsh, Curate of Hursley, in the year 1808.&nbsp;
It was well and carefully done, with a considerable amount of
antiquarian knowledge.&nbsp; It reached a second edition, and a
good deal of it was used in <i>Sketches of Hampshire</i>, by John
Duthy, Esq.&nbsp; An interleaved copy received many annotations
from members of the Heathcote family.&nbsp; There was a proposal
that it should be re-edited, but ninety years could not but make
a great difference in these days of progress, so that not only
had the narrative to be brought up to date, but further
investigations into the past brought facts to light which had
been unknown to Mr. Marsh.</p>
<p>It was therefore judged expedient to rewrite the whole,
though, whenever possible, the former Curate&rsquo;s work has
been respected and repeated; but he paid little attention to the
history of Otterbourne, and a good deal has been since disclosed,
rendering that village interesting.&nbsp; Moreover, the entire
careers of John Keble and Sir William Heathcote needed to be
recorded in their relations to the parish and county.&nbsp; This
has, therefore, here been attempted, together with a record of
the building of the three churches erected since 1837, and a
history of the changes that have taken place; though the writer
is aware that there is no incident to tempt the reader&mdash;no
siege of the one castle, no battle more important than the combat
in the hayfield between Mr. Coram and the penurious steward, and,
till the last generation, no striking character.&nbsp; But the
record of a thousand peaceful years is truly a cause of
thankfulness, shared as it is by many thousand villages, and we
believe that a little investigation would bring to light, in
countless other places, much that is well worth remembrance.</p>
<p>For the benefit of those who take an interest in provincial
dialect, some specimens are appended, which come from personal
knowledge.</p>
<p>The lists of birds and of flowers are both from the actual
observation of long residents who have known the country before,
in many instances, peculiarities have faded away before the march
of progress.</p>
<p>The writer returns many warm thanks to those who have given
much individual assistance in the undertaking, which could not
have been attempted without such aid.</p>

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>CHAPTER
I<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MERDON AND OTTERBOURNE</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> South Downs of England descend
at about eight miles from the sea into beds of clay, diversified
by gravel and sand, and with an upper deposit of peaty, boggy
soil, all having been brought down by the rivers of which the
Itchen and the Test remain.</p>
<p>On the western side of the Itchen, exactly at the border where
the chalk gives way to the other deposits, lies the ground of
which this memoir attempts to speak.&nbsp; It is uneven ground,
varied by undulations, with gravelly hills, rising above valleys
filled with clay, and both alike favourable to the growth of
woods.&nbsp; Fossils of belemnite, cockles (<i>cardium</i>), and
lamp-shells (<i>terebratula</i>) have been found in the chalk,
and numerous echini, with the pentagon star on their base, are
picked up in the gravels and called by the country people
Shepherds&rsquo; Crowns&mdash;or even fossil toads.&nbsp; Large
boulder stones are also scattered about the country, exercising
the minds of some observers, who saw in certain of them Druidical
altars, with channels for the flow of the blood, while others
discerned in these same grooves the scraping of the ice that
brought them down in the Glacial age.</p>
<p>But we must pass the time when the zoophytes were at work on
our chalk, when the lamp-shells rode at anchor on shallow waves,
when the cockles sat &ldquo;at their doors in a rainbow
frill,&rdquo; and the belemnites spread their cuttlefish arms to
the sea, and darkened the water for their enemies with their
store of ink.</p>
<p>Nor can we dwell on the deer which left their bones and horns
in the black, boggy soil near the river, for unfortunately these
were disinterred before the time when diggers had learnt to
preserve them for museums, and only reported that they had seen
remains.</p>
<p>Of <i>human</i> times, a broken quern was brought to light
when digging the foundation of Otterbourne Grange; and bits of
pottery have come to light in various fields at Hursley,
especially from the barrows on Cranbury Common.&nbsp; In 1882 and
1883 the Dowager Lady Heathcote, assisted by Captain John Thorp,
began to search the barrows on the left hand side of the high
road from Hursley to Southampton, and found all had been opened
in the centre, but scarcely searched at all on the sides.&nbsp;
In July they found four or five urns of unbaked clay in one
barrow&mdash;of early British make, very coarse, all either full
of black earth or calcined bones, and all inverted and very rough
in material, with the exception of one which was of a finer
material, red, and like a modern flower-pot in shape.&nbsp;
Several of these urns were deposited in the Hartley Museum,
Southampton.</p>
<p>Of the Roman times we know nothing but that part of the great
Roman road between Caer Gwent (or Venta Belgarum, as the Romans
called Winchester) and Sorbiodunum (Old Sarum).&nbsp; It can
still be traced at Hursley, and fragments of another leading to
Clausentum (Southampton) on the slope of Otterbourne hill.</p>
<p>In Dr. Milner&rsquo;s <i>History of Winchester</i>, written at
the end of the last century, he describes a medallion of mixed
metal bearing the head of Julius C&aelig;sar, which was dug up by
a labourer at Otterbourne, in the course of making a new
road.&nbsp; He thought it one of the plates carried on the Roman
standards of the maniples; but alas! on being sent, in 1891, to
be inspected at the British Museum, it was pronounced to be one
of a cinquecento series of the twelve C&aelig;sars.</p>
<p>The masters of the world have left us few traces of their
possession, and in fact the whole district was probably scarcely
inhabited; but the trees and brushwood or heather of the southern
country would have joined the chalk downs, making part of what
the West Saxons called the Jotunwald, or Giant&rsquo;s Wood, and
the river Ytene, and so Itchen seems to have been named in like
manner.</p>
<p>These were the times when churches were built and the
boundaries of estates became those of parishes.&nbsp; The manor
of Merdon, which occupied the whole parish of Hursley, belonged
to the Bishops of Winchester by a grant of Oynegils, first
Christian King.&nbsp; Milner, in his <i>History of
Winchester</i>, wishes to bestow on Merdon the questionable
honour of having been the place where, in the year 754, the West
Saxon King Cenwulf was murdered by his brother in the house of
his lady-love; but Mr. Marsh, the historian of Hursley, proves at
some length that Merton in Surrey was more likely to have been
the scene of the tragedy.</p>
<p>Church property being exempted from William the
Conqueror&rsquo;s great survey, neither Merdon nor Hursley
appears in Domesday Book, though Otterbourne, and even the
hundred of Boyate or Boviate, as it is in the book, appear
there.&nbsp; It had once belonged, as did Baddesley first, at
first to one named Chepney, then to Roger de Mortimer, that
fierce Norman warrior who was at first a friend and afterwards an
enemy to William I.</p>
<p>The entire district, except the neighbourhood of Merdon Manor
on the one hand, and of the Itchen on the other, was probably
either forest ground or downs, but it escaped the being put under
forest laws at the time when the district of Ytene became the New
Forest.&nbsp; Probably the king was able to ride over down,
heather, and wood, scarcely meeting an enclosure the whole way
from Winchester; and we can understand his impatience of the
squatters in the wilder parts, though the Cistercian Abbey of
Beaulieu was yet to be founded.&nbsp; Indeed Professor E. A.
Freeman does not accept the statement that there could possibly
have been thirty-nine village churches to be destroyed in the
whole district of &ldquo;Ytene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tradition lingered to the present time at Otterbourne that
the corpse of William Rufus was brought back in Purkiss&rsquo;s
wood-cart from Minestead to Winchester for burial in the
Cathedral, along a track leading from Hursley to Otterbourne,
called at each end King&rsquo;s Lane, though it is not easy to
see how the route could have lain through both points.</p>
<p>The parish of Hursley lies in the hundred of Buddlesgate, and
division of Fawley; and the village is situated on the
turnpike-road leading from Winchester to Romsey, and nearly at an
equal distance from each of those places.</p>
<p>The parishes by which Hursley is surrounded were, when Mr.
Marsh wrote, Sparsholt on the north; Farley on the north-west;
Michelmersh and Romsey on the west; Baddesley, North Stoneham,
and Otterbourne on the south; and Compton and St. Cross on the
east.</p>
<p>The whole parish was then upwards of twenty-eight miles in
circumference, and contained 10,590 acres of land, of which 2600
were in common, 372 in roads and lanes, about 1000 under growth
of coppice-wood, and the rest either arable or pasture.</p>
<p>The soil in the parish of Hursley, as may be supposed in so
extensive a tract of land, is of several different sorts; in some
parts it is light and shallow, and of a chalky nature; in others,
particularly on the east and west sides of the parish, it is what
is called <i>strong</i> land, having clay for its basis; and in
others, especially that of the commons and fields adjoining, it
consists principally of sand or gravel.&nbsp; Towards the west,
it is entirely covered with wood, not in general bearing trees of
large size, but some beautiful beech-trees; and breaking into
peaty, boggy ground on the southern side.&nbsp; The northern side
is of good rich loam, favourable to the growth of fine trees, and
likewise forms excellent arable land.&nbsp; This continues along
the valley of Otterbourne, along a little brook which falls into
the Itchen.&nbsp; It is for the most part of thick clay, fit for
brick-making, with occasional veins of sand, and where
Otterbourne hill rises, beds of gravel begin and extend to the
borders of the Itchen, through a wooded slope known as
Otterbourne Park.</p>
<p>The boundaries of estates fixed those of parishes, and
Otterbourne was curiously long and narrow, touching on Compton
and Twyford to the north and north-west, on Stoneham to the
south, and Hursley to the west, lying along the bank of the
Itchen.</p>
<p>The churches of both parishes were probably built in the
twelfth century, for though Hursley Church has been twice, if not
three times, rebuilt, remains of early Norman mouldings have been
found built into the stone-work of the tower.&nbsp; And on the
wall of the old Otterbourne Church a very rude fresco came
partially to light.&nbsp; Traced in red was a quatrefoil within a
square, the corners filled up with what had evidently been the
four Cherubic figures, though only the Winged Ox was clearly
traceable.&nbsp; Within the quatrefoil was a seated Figure, with
something like scales in one hand, apparently representing our
Lord in His glory.&nbsp; The central compartment was much broken
away, but there was the outline of a man whom one in a hairy
garment was apparently baptizing.&nbsp; The rest had
disappeared.</p>
<p>These paintings surmounted three acutely-pointed arches, with
small piers, and square on the side next the nave, but on the
other side slender shafts with bell-shaped capitals, carved with
bold round mouldings and deep hollows.&nbsp; Two corbels
supporting the horizontal drip-stone over the west window were
also clear and sharply cut; and the doorway on the south side had
slender shafts and deep mouldings, in one of which is the
dog-tooth moulding going even down to the ground on each
side.&nbsp; This is still preserved in the entrance to the
Boys&rsquo; School.</p>
<p>These remnants date the original building for about the
thirteenth century.&nbsp; It may have been due to King
Stephen&rsquo;s brother, Bishop Henry de Blois of Winchester, who
is known to have raised the castle whose remains still exist on
his manor of Merdon, where once there had been a Roman
encampment.&nbsp; So far as his work can be traced, the first
thing he would do would be to have a similar embankment thrown
up, and a parapet made along the top, behind which men-at-arms
would be stationed, the ditch below having a stockade of sharp
stakes.&nbsp; In the middle of the enclosure a well was begun,
which had to go deeper and deeper through the chalk, till at last
water was found at 300 feet deep&mdash;a work that must have
lasted a year or more.&nbsp; Around the well, leaving only a
small courtyard, were all the buildings of the castle meant for
the Bishop&rsquo;s household and soldiers.&nbsp; The entrance to
it all was probably over a drawbridge across the great ditch
(which, on this side, was not less than 60 feet deep), and
through a great gateway between two high square towers, which
must have stood where now there is a slope leading down from the
level of the inner court to that surrounded by a bank.&nbsp; This
slope is probably formed by the ruins of the gateway and tower
having been pitched into the ditch, as the readiest way of
getting rid of them when the castle was dismantled
afterwards.&nbsp; We are indebted to the late Sir John Cowell for
the conjectural plan and description of the castle.</p>
<p>As soon as the Bishop had completed this much he would feel
tolerably safe, but he would not be satisfied.&nbsp; He could
hardly have room in his castle for all his retainers, and he
could not command the country from it, except towards the south;
therefore his next work was to make an embankment and the ditch
on the outer side of it.&nbsp; It was then an unbroken
semicircle, jutting out as it were from the castle, and
protecting a sufficient space of ground for troops to encamp.</p>

</a></p>
<p>In case of an enemy forcing their way into this, the defenders
could retreat into the castle by the drawbridge.&nbsp; The
entrance was on the east side, and in order to protect this and
the back of the castle, by which is meant the northern side,
another embankment was made and finished with a parapet.&nbsp;
Also as, in case of this being carried by the enemy, it would be
impossible for the defenders in the northern part of the castle
to run round the castle and into shelter by the main gateway, he
built a square tower (exactly opposite to the ruin which yet
remains), and divided from it only by the great ditch.&nbsp; On
either side of the tower&mdash;cutting the embankment across,
therefore, at right angles&mdash;was a little ditch, spanned by a
drawbridge, which, if the defenders thought it necessary to
retire to the tower, could at any time be raised (the foundations
of the tower and the position of the ditches can still be
distinctly traced).&nbsp; Supposing, further, that it became
impossible to hold the tower, the besieged could retreat into the
main body of the castle by means of another drawbridge across the
great ditch, which would lead them through the arch (which can
still be seen in the ruins, though it is partially blocked
up).&nbsp; The room on the east side of this passage was probably
a guard-room.&nbsp; In some castles of this date there were also
two or three tunnels bored through the earth-work from the inner
courtyard to the bottom of the great ditch, so as to provide
additional ways of retreat for such men as might otherwise be cut
off in those parts most distant from either of the great gates,
in order to secure the outlying defence.</p>
<p>Henry de Blois must have been thinking of the many feudal
castles of his native France.&nbsp; He was a magnificent prelate,
though involved in the wars of his brother and the Empress
Matilda.&nbsp; The hospital of St. Cross, and much of the beauty
of Romsey Abbey, are ascribed to him, and he even endeavoured to
obtain that Winchester should be raised to the dignity of a
Metropolitan See.&nbsp; It does not appear that all his elaborate
defences at Merdon were ever called into practical use; and when
his brother, King Stephen, died in 1154, he fled from England,
and the young Henry II. in anger dismantled Merdon, together with
his other castles of Wolvesey and Waltham; nor were these
fortifications ever restored.&nbsp; The king and bishop were
reconciled; and the latter spent a pious and penitent old age,
only taking one meal a day, and spending the surplus in
charity.&nbsp; He died in 1174.</p>

13</span>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MEDI&AElig;VAL GIFTS</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was considered in the Middle
Ages that tithes might be applied to any church purpose, and were
not the exclusive right of the actual parish priest, provided he
obtained a sufficient maintenance, which in those days of
celibacy was not very expensive.&nbsp; The bishops and other
patrons thus assigned the great tithes of corn of many parishes
to religious foundations elsewhere, only leaving the incumbent
the smaller tithe from other crops&mdash;an arrangement which has
resulted in many abuses.</p>
<p>Thus in 1301, when Bishop Sawbridge or Points, or as it was
Latinised, de Pontissara, founded the college of St. Elizabeth,
in St. Stephen&rsquo;s, Merdon, by the Itchen at Winchester, for
the education of twelve poor boys by a provost and fellows, he
endowed it in part with the great tithe of Hursley.&nbsp; The
small tithes having been found insufficient for the maintenance
of the vicar, he united to Hursley the rectory of Otterbourne,
giving the great tithes to the vicar of Hursley; and in 1362
Bishop Edyngton confirmed the transaction.</p>
<p>Mr. Marsh thus relates the transaction:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Living of Hursley was anciently a rectory, and, as
it is believed, wholly unconnected with any other church or
parish.&nbsp; Unfortunately, however, for the parishioners, as
well as for the minister, it was, about the year 1300, reduced to
a vicarage, and the great tithes appropriated to the College of
St. Elizabeth in Winchester.&nbsp; The small tithes which
remained being inadequate to the support of the vicar and his
necessary assistants, the church of Otterbourne was consolidated
with that of Hursley, and the tithes of that parish, both great
and small, were given to them to make up a sufficient
maintenance&mdash;an arrangement which, in that dark age, was
thought not only justifiable but even laudable, but which
nevertheless deserves to this day to be severely censured, since
not only the minister but both the parishes and the cause of
religion have suffered a serious and continued injury from
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The person by whom this appropriation was made was John
de Pontissara, <i>alias</i> Points, Bishop of Winchester, the
founder of the college to which the tithes were granted; it was,
however, afterwards confirmed by William de Edyngton, by whom the
vicar&rsquo;s rights, which before were probably undefined, and
perhaps the subject of contention, were ascertained and secured
to him by endowment.&nbsp; This instrument is still in being,
bearing the date of 1362.&nbsp; It may be seen in Bishop
Edyngton&rsquo;s Register, part I, fol. 128, under the following
marginal title:&mdash;&lsquo;Ratificatio et Confirmatio
appropriationis Ecclesiae de Hursleghe, et ordinationes Vicarie
ejusd.&rsquo;&nbsp; The following is a translation of it, so far
as the vicar&rsquo;s interests are concerned in
it:&mdash;&lsquo;The said vicar shall have and receive all and
all manner of tithes, great and small, with all offerings and
other emoluments belonging to the chapel of Otterbourne, situated
within the parish of the said church (viz. of Hursley).&nbsp; He
shall also have and receive all offerings belonging to the church
of Hursley, and all small tithes arising within the parish of the
same, viz., the tithes of cheese, milk, honey, wax, pigs, lambs,
calves, eggs, chickens, geese, pigeons, flax, apples, pears, and
all other tithable fruits whatsoever of curtilages or
gardens.&nbsp; He shall also receive the tithes of mills already
erected, or that shall be erected.&nbsp; He shall also receive
and have all personal tithes of all traders, servants, labourers,
and artificers whatsoever, due to the said church.&nbsp; The said
Vicar shall also receive and have all mortuaries whatsoever, live
and dead, of whatsoever things they may consist.&nbsp; The said
Vicar shall also receive and have all profit and advantage
arising from the herbage of the churchyard.&nbsp; He shall also
have and receive the tithes of all fish-ponds whatsoever, within
the said parish, wheresoever made, or that hereafter shall be
made.&nbsp; The said Vicar shall also have for his habitation the
space on the south side of the churchyard, measuring in length,
from the said churchyard and the rectorial house, formerly
belonging to the said church, towards the south, twenty-seven
perches; and in breadth, from the hedge and ditch between the
said space and the garden of the aforesaid former rectory on the
west, towards the east, sixteen perches and a half, with the
buildings erected thereon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides the above, John de Pontissara allotted to the
Vicar the tithes of wool, beans, and vetches; but of the first of
these he was deprived by Bishop Edyngton&rsquo;s endowment, and
the latter have been so little cultivated that he has never yet
derived any advantage from them, though his right to this species
of tithes cannot, I suppose, be questioned, unless, indeed, they
are comprehended under the term <i>Bladum</i>, and are
consequently to be considered as the portion of the
Impropriator.&nbsp; The tithes given by the Endowment to the
President and Chaplains of St. Elizabeth College
are&mdash;&lsquo;Decim&aelig; Bladi cujuscunque generis,
F&oelig;ni ac Lan&aelig;,&rsquo; and no other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The church of Hursley is situated within the deanery of
Winchester, and is a Peculiar; <a name="citation17"></a><a
href="#footnote17" class="citation">[17]</a> a distinction which
it enjoys, probably, in consequence of its having been formerly
under the patronage of the bishop.&nbsp; The advantages of this
are, that it is not subject to the archdeacon&rsquo;s
jurisdiction; that the minister is not obliged to attend his
visitations; and that he has the privilege of granting letters of
administration to wills, when the property conveyed by them lies
within the limits of the vicarage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The value of the benefice, as rated in the King&rsquo;s
Book, is &pound;9 per annum, and the tenths are of course
18s.&nbsp; These the incumbent is required to pay annually, but
he is exempted from the payment of the First Fruits.&nbsp; The
land-tax with which the vicarage is charged is &pound;14: 1:
2&frac12; per annum; and the procurations and diet-money payable
on account of the Bishop&rsquo;s Visitation amount to 12s.
9&frac12;d.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The patronage of the living, when a rectory, belonged to the
bishops of Winchester, and afterwards, when reduced to a
vicarage, was expressly reserved to himself and his successors by
William de Edyngton; and so long as they kept possession of the
Manor of Merdon, they continued patrons of the vicarage.&nbsp;
This Bishop Edyngton, the same who began the alteration of the
cathedral, is said to have built the second church of All Saints
at Hurley, the tower of which still remains.</p>
<p>William of Wykeham, among his wider interests, seems to have
had little concern with Hursley or Otterbourne.</p>
<p>The bishops possessed numerous manors in the diocese, and
these were really not only endowments, but stations whence the
episcopal duty of visitation could be performed.&nbsp; Riding
forth with his train of clergy, chaplains, almoners, lawyers,
crossbearers, and choristers, besides his household of
attendants, the bishop entered a village, where the bells were
rung, priest, knight, franklins, and peasants came out with all
their local display, often a guild, to receive him, and other
clergy gathered in; mass was said, difficulties or controversies
attended to, confirmation given to the young people and children,
and, after a meal, the bishop proceeded, sometimes to a
noble&rsquo;s castle, or a convent, but more often to another
manor of his own, where he was received by his resident steward
or park-keeper, and took up his abode, the neighbouring clergy
coming in to pay their respects, mention their grievances, and
hold counsel with him.&nbsp; His dues were in the meantime
collected, and his residence lasted as long as business,
ecclesiastical or secular, required his presence, or till he and
his train had eaten up the dues in kind that came in.</p>
<p>Whether the visit was welcome or not depended a good deal on
the character of the prelate, and the hold he kept on his
subordinates.&nbsp; The great courtly bishops, like William of
Wykeham, generally sent their suffragans, titular bishops <i>in
partibus infidelium</i>, to perform their duties.</p>
<p>One of the park-keepers of Merdon was judged worthy of a Latin
epitaph, probably the work of a chaplain or of a Winchester
scholar to whom he had endeared himself:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hic in humo stratus, John Bowland est tumulatus<br
/>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Him, O Christ, befriend with those who are
thine!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unlike Hursley, or rather the Manor of Merdon, Otterbourne had
many different possessors in succession, and is even at the
present day divided into various holdings on different
tenures.</p>
<p>In 1244 Walter and John de Brompton, sons of Sir Bryan de
Brompton, lived at Hayswode, a name now lost or changed into
&ldquo;Otterbourne Park,&rdquo; the wood spreading over the east
side of the hill.&nbsp; At the same time Sir Henry de Capella was
possessor of the manor; but in 1265 it had passed, by what means
we do not know, to Sir Francis de Bohun&mdash;a very early
specimen of this Christian name which was derived from the
sobriquet of the Saint of Assisi, whose Christian name was
John.</p>
<p>From the son of Sir Francis in 1279 Simon the Draper obtained
the Manor of Otterbourne for 600 merks, and a quit rent of a pair
of gilt spurs valued at six pence!&nbsp; Simon seems to have
assumed the gilt spurs himself, for he next appears as &ldquo;Sir
Simon de Wynton.&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed it seems that knighthood
might be conferred on the possessors of a certain amount of
land.&nbsp; Wynton in two more generations has lengthened into
Wynchester, when, in 1379, the manor is leased to Hugh Croans,
merchant, and Isabella his wife for their lives, paying after the
first twenty-five years &pound;100 per annum.&nbsp; And two years
later William de Winchester conveyed the manor over to Hugh
Croans or Crans.</p>
<p>The great Bishop William of Wykeham bought it in 1386, and
gave it to his cousin, bearing the same name.&nbsp; It continued
in the Wykeham family till 1458, when William Fiennes or Fenys,
Lord Say and Sele, the son of him who was murdered by Jack
Cade&rsquo;s mob, being married to the heiress, Margaret Wykeham,
sold it to Bishop Waynflete for &pound;600.</p>
<p>The bishop&rsquo;s treasurer was Hugh Pakenham; and being one
of the feoffees to whom the manor was conveyed for the bishop, he
pretended that he had bought it for himself, and absconded with
some of the title deeds; but eventually he died <i>in magna
miseria</i> in sanctuary at St. Martin&rsquo;s le Grand,
Westminster.&nbsp; His son John renounced the pretended claim,
and very generously the Bishop gave him &pound;40.</p>
<p>In 1481, good Bishop Waynflete made over the property to his
newly-founded College of St. Mary Magdalen at Oxford, in whose
possession it has remained ever since, except small portions
which have been enfranchised from time to time.&nbsp; It includes
Otterbourne hill, with common land on the top and wood upon the
slope, as well as various meadows and plough lands.&nbsp; The
manor house, still bearing the name of the Moat House, was near
the old church in the meadows, and entirely surrounded with its
own moat.&nbsp; It must have been a house of some pretension in
the sixteenth century, for there is a handsome double staircase,
a rough fresco in one room, and in the lowest there was a panel
over the fireplace, with a painting representing apparently a
battle between Turks and Austrians.&nbsp; The President of
Magdalen College on progress always held his court there.&nbsp;
The venerable Dr. Rowth in extreme old age was the last who did
so.&nbsp; Since his time the bridge crossing the moat fell in and
choked it; it became a marsh; the farm was united to another, the
picture removed, and the only inhabitants are such a
labourer&rsquo;s family as may be impervious to the idea that it
is haunted.</p>
<p>Simon the Draper, otherwise Sir Simon de Wynton, granted a
plot of land to the north-west of the Manor House to Adam de
Lecke in villeinage, and later in freehold to John de
Otterbourne, reserving thirteen shillings rent.&nbsp; By this
last it was rented on his wife Alice, from whom it passed through
several hands to John Colpoys in the year of Henry VI., and
twenty-two years later this same John Colpoys agreed with the
warden and fellows of Winchester College to enfeoff them of one
messuage, four tofts, twenty acres of arable land, and eighteen
acres of meadow, to the intent that they should on the 7th day of
April in every year celebrate the <i>obits</i> of Alice his
deceased wife, of John Giles and Maud his wife (her parents), of
Sir John Shirborne and of Joan Parke, and of Colpoys himself and
Joan his then wife, after their respective deaths.</p>
<p>These <i>obits</i>, namely anniversaries of deaths when masses
were to be offered for the person recollected, were to be secured
by the fee of a shilling to the warden on each occasion, sixpence
to each fellow and chaplain, and likewise to the schoolmaster,
twopence to each lay clerk, sixpence to the sacrist for wax
candles, and a mark or thirteen and fourpence to be spent in a
&ldquo;pittance&rdquo; extra course in the college hall.&nbsp;
The indenture by which Colpoys hoped to secure perpetual masses
in remembrance of his relations and himself is in perfect
preservation, with seals attached, in the muniment chamber of
Winchester College.</p>
<p>The property has continued ever since in the possession of the
College of St. Mary, Winchester, though the masses ceased to be
celebrated after the Reformation.</p>
<p>In those days the rector of Hursley was John de Ralegh,
probably a kinsman of the bishop of that name.</p>
<p>Before this, however, Bishop Richard Toclive had a dispute
with the Knights of St. John, who claimed the almshouse of Noble
Poverty at St. Cross as Hospitallers.&nbsp; They had
unfortunately a reputation for avarice, and Toclive bought them
off by giving them the impropriation of Merton and Hursleigh <a
name="citation25"></a><a href="#footnote25"
class="citation">[25]</a> for 53 marks a year.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Paganus de Lyskeret</span>, styled
Presbyter, was collated in 1280.&nbsp; It appears that at this
time there was a perpetual vicar established in the Church of
Hursley as well as a rector; and that he was instituted by the
bishop, had a certain fixed maintenance assigned to him, and was
independent of the rector.&nbsp; In the register of John de
Pontissera, Bishop of Winton, may now be seen what is there
called the &ldquo;Ordinatio Episcopi inter Rectorem et Vicarium
de Hurslegh.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is therein settled that the vicar
shall have a house as described and other emoluments, and that
the rector shall pay to him forty shillings per annum.&nbsp; The
vicar at this time was Johannes de Sta. Fide.&nbsp; The deed of
settlement was executed in Hyde Abbey, in the year 1291; Philip
de Barton, John de Ffleming, William de Wenling, and others being
witnesses to it.&nbsp; Vide Regist. de Pontissera, fol. 10.&nbsp;
Forty shillings or five marks was, it appears, the stipend
usually assigned to vicars and curates at this time, the vicar
being <i>really</i> what we now call a curate.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hugo de Welewyck</span>, styled Clericus,
succeeded in 1296 on the resignation of Paganus and was the last
rector, the benefice having in his time been reduced to a
vicarage by the appropriation of the rectorial-house, tithes, and
glebe to the College of St. Elizabeth.&nbsp; The <i>pretences</i>
assigned for this act, for true <i>reasons</i> they could
scarcely be, since in all cases of appropriation and
consolidation they appear to have been almost exactly the same,
were the unfinished state of the college buildings and the
insufficiency of the revenues for the maintenance of the society,
owing to wars, sickness, pestilence, and the like.&nbsp; But
notwithstanding this serious deprivation and loss, a vicar it
appears was still continued in the church, Hugh de Welewyck
having presented two, viz. Henricus de Lyskeret in 1300, and
Roger de la Vere in 1302; of whom the latter was certainly
appointed after the appropriation.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William de Ffarlee</span> was collated

<span class="GutSmall">REFORMATION TIMES</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> rectorial tithe of Hursley
having been given to St. Elizabeth&rsquo;s College, and
apparently some rights over Merdon, the Chancellor Wriothesley
obtained that, on the confiscation of monastic property, the
manor should be granted to him.&nbsp; Stephen Gardiner had been
bishop since 1531, a man who, though he had consented to the
king&rsquo;s assumption of the royal supremacy, grieved over the
fact as an error all his life.&nbsp; He appeared at the bar of
the House of Commons and pleaded the rights of his See, to which
Merdon had belonged for 1300 years.&nbsp; It was probably in
consequence of his pleading that Wriothesley restored the manor,
but when Gardiner was illegally deposed by the regency of Edward
VI. on 14th February 1550, John Poynet, a considerable scholar,
but a man of disgraceful life, obtained the appointment to the
see, by alienating various estates to the Seymour family, and
Merdon was resumed by the Crown.&nbsp; It was then granted to Sir
Philip Hobby who had been one of King Henry&rsquo;s privy
councillors, and had been sent on an embassy to Portugal,
attended by ten gentlemen of his own retinue, wearing velvet
coats with chains of gold.</p>
<p>Already had come to the hamlet of Slackstead in Hursley Parish
another reformer, Thomas Sternhold, who had been gentleman of the
bed-chamber to Henry VIII., and had put thirty-seven Psalms into
English verse, in hopes of improving the morals of the
Court.&nbsp; John Hopkins and Robert Wisdom completed the
translation of the Psalms, which Fuller in his history says was
at first derided and scoffed at as piety rather than poetry,
adding that the good gentleman had drunk more of Jordan than of
Helicon.&nbsp; In his <i>Worthies</i>, however, he says:
&ldquo;He was afterwards (saith my author) <i>ab intimo
cubiculo</i> to King Edward the Sixth; though I am not satisfied
whether thereby he meant gentleman of his privy chamber or groom
of his bed-chamber.&nbsp; He was a principal instrument of
translating the Psalms into English metre; the first twenty-six
(and seven-and-thirty in all) <a name="citation28"></a><a
href="#footnote28" class="citation">[28]</a> being by him
performed.&nbsp; Yet had he other assistance in that work.&nbsp;
Many a bitter scoff hath since been passed on their endeavours by
some wits, which might have been better employed.&nbsp; Some have
miscalled these their translations <i>Geneva gigs</i>
(<i>i.e.</i> jigs); and which is the worst, father (or mother
rather) the expression on our virgin queen, as falsely as other
things have been charged upon her.&nbsp; Some have not sticked to
say &lsquo;that David hath been as much persecuted by bungling
translators as by Saul himself.&rsquo;&nbsp; Some have made
libellous verses in abuse of them, and no wonder if songs were
made on the translators of the Psalms, seeing drunkards made them
on David the author thereof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But let these translations be beheld by impartial eyes,
and they will be allowed to go in equipage with the best poems in
that age.&nbsp; However, it were to be wished that some bald
rhymes therein were bettered; till which time, such as sing them
must endeavour to amend them by singing them with understanding
heads and gracious hearts, whereby that which is bad metre on
earth will be made good music in heaven.&nbsp; As for our Thomas
Sternhold, it was happy for him that he died before his good
master, anno 1549, in the month of August; so probably preventing
much persecution which had happened unto him if surviving in the
reign of Queen Mary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was Fuller&rsquo;s judgment and that of the author he
quotes, nevertheless the version of the Psalms, being printed
with the Prayer-Book, took such a strong hold of the nation that
in 1798 Hannah More was accused of dissent, because the version
of Tate and Brady was used in her schools.&nbsp; Mr. Keble
preferred it to this latter as more like the Hebrew, and some of
his versions (curiously enough proceeding from the same parish)
remind us of these simple old translators.&nbsp; The Old
Hundredth, and in some degree the 23rd and the opening of the
18th, still hold their place, probably in virtue of the music to
which they are wedded.</p>
<p>Bishop Gardiner recovered the Manor of Merdon, with his
liberty, on Queen Mary&rsquo;s accession.&nbsp; Then it was that
Philip of Spain rode through one of these villages, probably
Otterbourne, soaked through with rain, on his way to his
ill-starred marriage with Mary.</p>
<p>Gardiner was no persecutor, and Sternhold&rsquo;s widow lived
on at Slackstede.&nbsp; On his death, Queen Mary gave the diocese
to John White, the same who preached to Elizabeth on a living dog
being better than a dead lion.</p>
<p>Hobby then claimed the manor, but Bishop White made a
strenuous resistance, appealing to Gardiner&rsquo;s former plea,
and supported by the Attorney General Story, who is said to have
been an enemy of Sir Philip Hobby.&nbsp; The case was argued in
the House of Lords, and given against the bishop, though under
the protest of several of the Lords Spiritual, who dreaded the
like treatment.</p>
<p>Story was prosecuted by the Commons for pleading before the
Lords, fled to the Netherlands and was trepanned on board an
English ship, and put to death as a traitor.</p>
<p>Bishop White was deprived the next year, and retired to his
sister&rsquo;s house at South Warnborough, where he died.&nbsp;
Queen Elizabeth is said to have visited him.</p>
<p>Merdon was thus in 1558 for ever alienated from the diocese of
Winchester.&nbsp; Sir Philip Hobby is said to have first built
the Lodge, as it was called, of Hursley Park, about a quarter of
a mile from Merdon Castle, which had become ruinous.&nbsp; Those
were the days when the massive walls and minute comfortless
chambers were deserted, defence being less thought of than
convenience in our happy country; and indeed Sir Philip seems to
have used Hursley as a residence instead of only a shelter on a
tour.&nbsp; He died at Bisham aged 53, on the 31st of May 1558,
soon after his victory over the See of Winchester, and is there
buried, as well as his elder brother, Sir Thomas.&nbsp; He left
no children, and was succeeded by his brother William, who had
married the widow of Sternhold.&nbsp; On her death the following
memorial was erected over a stone bearing the coat, &ldquo;On a
chevron embattled, between three griffins&rsquo; heads erased,
three roses; and on a brass the inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If ever chaste or honest godly
lyfe<br />
Myght merit prayse . of everlastyng fame<br />
Forget not then . that worthy Sternhold&rsquo;s wife<br />
Our Hobbie&rsquo;s make .&nbsp; Anne Horswell cald by name<br />
From whome alas . to sone for hers here left<br />
Hath God her Soule . deth her lyfe byreft,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Anno 1559.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His property at Hursley descended to his son Giles Hobby,
Esq., who, it appears clearly by the register and other records,
was living in the parish very early in the seventeenth
century.&nbsp; His last wife was Ann, the daughter of Sir Thomas
Clarke, Knight of Avyngton <a name="citation32"></a><a
href="#footnote32" class="citation">[32]</a> in Berkshire, to
whom he sold the castle and manor of Merdon, reserving, however
to himself and wife, a life-holding in the lodge and park.&nbsp;
When this sale was made does not appear, but it is supposed to
have been before the year 1602, as Sir Thomas was then living at
Merdon, and his son married in that year at Hursley.&nbsp; Giles
Hobby died in the year 1626, and his wife in 1630.&nbsp; They
were both buried at Hursley, probably in the church, but no
monument appears to have been erected to their memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Thomas Clarke may be considered as the next lord of
Merdon, though he was never in possession of either the lodge or
the park, and held only for a few years what he did
possess.&nbsp; So long, however, as he continued proprietor of
the manor, it is said that he lived at <i>Merdon</i>, I suppose
at the castle, a part of which was probably then standing and
habitable.&nbsp; Sir Thomas, it would seem, kept the demesne
lands in his own occupation, requiring the tenants or copyholders
of the manor, according to ancient usage, to perform the
customary service of reaping and housing his crops: (1) The days
employed in this service were called Haydobyn days; (2) and
during their continuance the lord was obliged to provide
breakfast and dinner for the workmen.&nbsp; Richard Morley, in
his Manuscript, gives a very curious account of a quarrel which
occurred on one of these occasions. &lsquo;Another time&rsquo;
(says he) &lsquo;upon a haydobyn-day (320 or 340 reapers) the
cart brought a-field for them a hogs-head of porridge, which
stunk and had worms swimming in it.&nbsp; The reapers refused to
work without better provisions.&nbsp; Mr. Coram of Cranbury would
not suffer them to work.&nbsp; Mr. Pye, Sir Thomas Clarke&rsquo;s
steward, and Coram drew their daggers, and rode at each other
through the wheat.&nbsp; At last Lady Clarke promised to dress
for them two or three hogs of bacon: twenty nobles&rsquo; work
lost.&rsquo;&nbsp; He adds, that &lsquo;a heire (hire) went for a
man on the haydobyn-days, if able to carry a hooke
a-field.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This &ldquo;haydobyn&rdquo; is supposed by Mr. Marsh to be a
corruption of the old word &ldquo;haydogtime,&rdquo; <a
name="citation34"></a><a href="#footnote34"
class="citation">[34]</a> a word signifying a country
dance.&nbsp; It seems that when the tenants were called on to
perform work in hedging, reaping, or hay-making, upon the lands
of the lord of the manor, in lieu of money rent he was bound to
feed them through the day, and generally to conclude with a
merry-making.&nbsp; So, no doubt, it had been in the good old
days of the bishops and the much loved and lamented John Bowland;
but harder times had come with Sir Thomas Clarke, when it
required the interference of Mr. Coram of Cranbury to secure them
even an eatable meal.&nbsp; No doubt such stout English
resistance saved the days of compulsory labour from becoming a
burden intolerable as in France.</p>
<p>Roger Coram, gent., rented Cranbury at &pound;17: 2s.&nbsp;
Cranbury is a low wooded hill, then part of the manor of Merdon,
nearly two miles to the south-east of Hursley, and in that
parish, though nearer to Otterbourne.&nbsp; Several tenements
seem to have been there, those in the valley being called Long
Moor and Pot Kiln.&nbsp; Shoveller is the first name connected
with Cranbury, but Mr. Roger Coram, the champion of the
haymakers, held it till his death, when it passed to Sir Edward
Richards.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Brambridge, which stands in Twyford parish,
but held part of the hundred of Boyatt in Otterbourne, was in the
hands of the Roman Catholic family of Welles, who seem to have
had numerous retainers at Highbridge, Allbrook, and Boyatt.&nbsp;
Swithun Welles made Brambridge a refuge for priests, and two or
three masses were said in his house each day.&nbsp; One
&ldquo;Ben Beard,&rdquo; a spy, writes in 1584 that if certain
priests were not at Brambridge they would probably be at Mr.
Strange&rsquo;s at Mapledurham, where was a hollow place by the
livery cupboard capable of containing two men.</p>
<p>Swithun Welles went later to London and took a house in
Holborn, where Topcliffe the priest-catcher broke in on Father
Genings saying mass, and both he and Mr. Welles were hanged
together for what was adjudged in those days to be a treasonable
offence, implying disaffection to the Queen. <a
name="citation36"></a><a href="#footnote36"
class="citation">[36]</a></p>
<p>The modern house of Brambridge affords no priests&rsquo;
chambers.&nbsp; It is believed that an older one was burnt down,
and there is a very dim report that a priest was drowned in a
stone basin in a neighbouring wood.</p>
<p>The register of Twyford Church contains the record of a number
of the Welles family buried in the churchyard clandestinely, by
night.&nbsp; John Wells, mentioned in the Athen&aelig; Oxoniensis
as an able man living at Deptford, retired to Brambridge, and
died there in 1634.&nbsp; This accounts for there having been the
Roman Catholic school at Twyford, whence Alexander Pope was
expelled for some satirical verses on the master.&nbsp; The house
is still known.</p>
<p>The vicars of Hursley at this period were John Hynton,
presented by Bishop Gardiner, but deprived in on account of his
tenets.&nbsp; Richard Fox was presented in his place by William
Hobby.&nbsp; It must have been owing to the reforming zeal of
this vicar of Hursley that the frescoes in Otterbourne Church
were as far as possible effaced, white-washed over, and the Ten
Commandments painted over them in old English lettering, part of
which was still legible in 1839.&nbsp; Otterbourne was apparently
still served by the vicar of Hursley or his assistant.</p>
<p>Parish Registers began at this date, and here are the
remarkable occurrences recorded at Hursley:</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Extraordinary Occurrences</span>, <span
class="smcap">Etc</span>.</h3>
<p>1582.&nbsp; A great hail storm happened at Hursley, Baddesley,
and in the neighbourhood, this year.&nbsp; The hail-stones
measured nine inches in circumference.</p>
<p>1604.&nbsp; The plague made its appearance at Anfield.&nbsp;
It broke out in November, and continued till the following
February.&nbsp; Many persons died of it, and were not brought to
the church, but buried in the waste near their residence.</p>
<p>1610.&nbsp; A person of the name of Wooll hanged himself at
Gosport, in the parish of Hursley, about this time.&nbsp; He was
buried at the corner of Newland&rsquo;s Coppice, and a stake was
driven through his body.&nbsp; (The place still bears the name of
Newland&rsquo;s Coppice.)</p>
<p>1621.&nbsp; A planked thrashing-floor first laid down in the
parish this year, viz. at Merdon.&nbsp; Chalk-floors used
before.&nbsp; It was reckoned a memorable improvement.</p>
<p>1629.&nbsp; A great fall of snow in October.&nbsp; It was
nearly half a foot deep, and remained on the ground three or four
days.</p>
<p>1635.&nbsp; A copyholder was hanged for murder this
year.&nbsp; His copyhold was seized by the lord as forfeited, but
afterwards recovered, viz. in 1664.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">PURITAN TIMES</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">After</span> his dispute with the
haymakers, Sir Thomas Clarke sold Merdon to William Brock, a
lawyer, from whom it passed to John Arundel, and then to Sir
Nathanael Napier, whose son, Sir Gerald, parted with it again to
Richard Maijor, the son of the mayor of Southampton.&nbsp; This
was in 1638, and for some time the lodge at Hursley was lent to
Mr. Kingswell, Mr. Maijor&rsquo;s father-in-law, who died there
in 1639, after which time Mr. Maijor took up his abode
there.&nbsp; He seems to have been a shrewd, active man, and a
staunch Protestant, for when there was a desire to lease out
Cranbury, he, as Lord of the Manor, stipulated that it should be
let only to a Protestant of the Church of England, not to a
Papist.&nbsp; The neighbourhood of the Welleses at Brambridge
probably moved him to make this condition.</p>
<p>The person who applied for the lease was Dr. John Young, Dean
of Winchester, who purchased the copyhold of Cranbury before
1643, and retired thither when he was expelled from his deanery
and other preferments in the evil times of the Commonwealth, and
there died, leaving his widow in possession.</p>
<p>Whether the lady was molested by Mr. Maijor we do not
know.&nbsp; He was no favourite with Richard Morley, who rented
the forge in Hursley, the farm of Ratlake and Anvyle, as Ampfield
was then spelt, and thought him a severe lord to his
copyholders.&nbsp; Morley was born at Hursley, and was sent to
school at Baddesley in 1582, the year of the great hailstorm of
the nine-inch stones.&nbsp; He kept valuable memoranda, which Mr.
Marsh quotes, and died in 1672, when he is registered
as:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ricardus Morley Senex sepultus fuit, August
1672.&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>Senex</i> indeed, for he must have been
97.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of Maijor, Morley records, &ldquo;He was very witty and
thrifty, and got more by oppressing his tenants than did all the
lords in 60 years before him.&nbsp; He was a justice of the
peace, and raised a troop in the cause of the
Parliament.&rdquo;&nbsp; It must have been in the army that
Oliver Cromwell made his acquaintance, and in 1647 began the
first proposals of a &ldquo;Marriage treaty,&rdquo; between
Richard, Oliver&rsquo;s eldest surviving son, just twenty-one and
educated for the Law, and the elder daughter of Mr. Maijor (which
Carlyle always spells as Mayor).&nbsp; For the time, however,
this passed off; but, apparently under the direction of Mr.
Robertson, a minister of Southampton, and Mr. Stapylton, also a
minister, the treaty was resumed; and three weeks after the
King&rsquo;s execution, Oliver wrote to Mr. Maijor.</p>
<blockquote><p>For my very worthy friend, Richard Mayor, Esq.:
These.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
12<i>th</i> <i>February</i> 1648.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>&mdash;I received some
intimations formerly, and by the last return from Southampton a
Letter from Mr. Robinson, concerning the reviving of the last
year&rsquo;s motion, touching my Son and your Daughter.&nbsp; Mr.
Robinson was also pleased to send enclosed in his, a Letter from
you, bearing date the 5th of this instant, February, wherein I
find your willingness to entertain any good means for the
completing of that business.</p>
<p>From whence I take encouragement to send my Son to wait upon
you; and by him to let you know, that my desires are, if
Providence so dispose, very full and free to the thing,&mdash;if
upon an interview, there prove also a freedom in the young
persons thereunto.&nbsp; What liberty you will give herein, I
wholly submit to you.&nbsp; I thought fit, in my Letter to Mr.
Robinson, to mention somewhat of expedition because indeed I know
not how soon I may be called into the field, or other occasions
may remove me from hence; having for the present some liberty of
stay in London.&nbsp; The Lord direct all to His glory.&mdash;I
rest, Sir, your very humble servant,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Oliver
Cromwell</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probably this was the time when the public-house of Hursley
took the name of &ldquo;The King&rsquo;s Head,&rdquo; which it
has kept to the present day.&nbsp; But young Cromwell was
inclined to loyalty, and when at Cambridge used to drink
&ldquo;to the health of our landlord,&rdquo; meaning the
King!&nbsp; He was one-and-twenty when, with his father&rsquo;s
friend Mr. Stapylton, he made a visit to Hursley, and was
received by Mr. and Mrs. Maijor with many civilities, also seeing
their two daughters, Dorothy and Anne.&nbsp; In a letter of 28th
February, Cromwell thanks Mr. Maijor for &ldquo;The reception of
my son, in the liberty given him to wait on your worthy daughter,
the report of whose virtues and godliness has so great a place in
my heart that I think fit not to neglect anything on my part
which may consummate a close of the business, if God please to
dispose the young ones&rsquo; hearts thereunto, and other
suitable ordering of affairs towards mutual satisfaction appear
in the dispensation of Providence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Stapylton was commissioned to act for General Cromwell in
the matter of settlements, over which there was considerable
haggling, though Oliver writes that &ldquo;the report of the
young lady&rsquo;s godliness causeth him to deny himself in the
matter of moneys.&rdquo;&nbsp; More correspondence ensued, as to
the settlement of Hursley upon Dorothy and her heirs male, and
the compensation to her younger sister Anne.&nbsp; Cromwell was
anxious to hurry on the matter so as to have it concluded before
his departure to take the command in Ireland.</p>
<p>The terms were finally settled, and Richard and Dorothy were
married at Hursley on May Day, 1649, before Cromwell&rsquo;s
departure to crush the ill-arranged risings in Ireland.&nbsp; Her
sister Anne shortly after married John Dunch of Baddesley, with
&pound;1000 as her portion.&nbsp; Morley of Baddesley chronicles
the marriage in no friendly tone: &ldquo;When&rdquo; (says he)
&ldquo;King Charles was put to death, and Oliver Cromwell
Protector of England, and Richard Maijor of his privy council,
and Noll his eldest son Richard married to Mr. Maijor&rsquo;s
daughter Doll, then Mr. Maijor did usurp authority over his
tenants at Hursley.&rdquo;&nbsp; In another place he says that
&ldquo;he&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> Mr. Maijor) &ldquo;set forth horse
and man for the Parliament, and was a captain and justice of
peace.&nbsp; Lord Richard Cromwell was also a justice of peace,
and John Dunch a captain and justice.&nbsp; These all lived at
Lodge together in Oliver&rsquo;s reign; so we had justice right
or wrong by power; for if we did offend, they had power to send
us a thousand miles off, and that they have told us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard, having no turn for politics or warfare, preferred to
live a quiet life with his father-in-law, in the lodge.&nbsp;
There were two walnut avenues planted about this time, leading to
the lodge from the churchyard on one side, and on the other
towards Baddesley; and the foundations of the house can still be
traced on the lawn to which both lead.</p>
<p>Oliver writes in the summer after the marriage that he is glad
the young people have leisure to make a journey to eat
cherries.&nbsp; There is little doubt but that this must have
been to the gardens in Ram-Alley near Chandler&rsquo;s Ford,
originally Chaloner&rsquo;s Ford, where numerous trees, bearing
quantities of little black cherries called merries, used to grow,
and where parties used to go as a Sunday diversion, and eat,
before the days of the station and the building.</p>
<p>The elder Mrs. Cromwell paid a visit to Hursley after parting
with the Protector on his voyage to Ireland; but he never seems
to have gone thither in person, though he wrote kindly paternal
letters to his son and daughter.&nbsp; He wishes Richard to study
mathematics and cosmography, and read history, especially Sir
Walter Raleigh&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a Body of history, and
will add much more to your understanding than fragments of
story.&rdquo;&nbsp; And to Dorothy, he gives advice on her health
and religious habits.</p>
<p>John Hardy had been Vicar of Hursley but was expelled, and Mr.
Maijor, as patron of the living, provided persons for the
ministry and kept a close account of their expenses, which is
still preserved.&nbsp; Seven different ministers in the half year
after Christmas 1645 were remunerated &ldquo;for travell and
pains in preaching,&rdquo; after which time Mr. Richard Webb
settled for a time at Hursley, and Mr. Daniel Lloyd at
Otterbourne, though several more changes took place.</p>
<p>A parish register at Hursley, 1653, recording births (not
baptisms), mentions the opening of a chalk-pit at Hatchgate in
1655, and at Otterbourne.&nbsp; The children of William Downe of
Otterbourne Farm are distinguished by double black lines below
their names.</p>
<p>Oliver Cromwell, according to an old village tradition, sunk
his treasure at the bottom of Merdon Well, in an iron chest which
must have been enchanted, for, on an endeavour to draw it up, no
one was to speak.&nbsp; One workman unfortunately said,
&ldquo;Here it comes,&rdquo; when it immediately sank to the
bottom and (this is quite certain) never was seen!&nbsp; The well
was cleaned out in later times, and nothing was found but a pair
of curious pattens, cut away to receive a high-heeled shoe, also
a mazer-bowl, an iron flesh-hook and small cooking-pot, and a
multitude of pins, thrown in to make the curious reverberating
sound when, after several seconds, they reached the water.&nbsp;
A couple of ducks are said to have been thrown down, and to have
emerged at Pool hole at Otterbourne with their feathers scraped
off.</p>
<p>On 3rd September 1658, the family party at Hursley was broken
up by the unexpected death of the Protector.&nbsp; He was not yet
sixty years of age, and had not contemplated being cut off before
affairs were more settled; and when, in his last moments, he was
harassed with enquiries as to his successor, he answered,
&ldquo;You will find my will in <i>such</i> a drawer of my
cabinet.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some of his counsellors thought he named
his son Richard; and no one ever found the drawer with the will
in it, in which it was thought that his son-in-law Fleetwood, a
much abler man, was named.</p>
<p>At any rate, Richard was accepted in his father&rsquo;s place
by Parliament and army, and went to much expense for the
Protector&rsquo;s funeral.&nbsp; It must have been a great
misfortune to him that his shrewd father-in-law, the witty and
thrifty Mr. Maijor, was sinking under a complication of incurable
diseases, of which Morley speaks somewhat unkindly, and he died
in the end of April 1660.</p>
<p>Richard had never been a strong partisan of the Commonwealth,
though he had quietly submitted to whatever was required of
him.&nbsp; He had been member of Parliament for the county of
Hants, and had been placed at the head of the list of his
father&rsquo;s attempt at a House of Lords, and he allowed
greatness to be thrust on him in a quiet acquiescent way.&nbsp;
He dismissed the fictitious parliament that his father had
summoned, and then offended the strict and godly of the army by
promoting soldiers of whom they disapproved.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here is
Dick Ingoldsby,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;he can neither pray nor
preach, and yet I trust him before you all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one had any real enthusiasm for the harmless, helpless man,
&ldquo;the phantom king of half a year&rdquo;; and it was just as
old Mr. Maijor was dying that Richard was requested by the
&ldquo;Rump&rdquo; to resign, and return to Hampton Court, with
the promise of a pension and of payment of the debts incurred by
his father.&nbsp; While packing for his departure, he sat down on
a box containing all the complimentary addresses made to him, and
said, &ldquo;Between my legs lie the lives and fortunes of all
the good folk in England!&rdquo;&nbsp; He then returned to
Hursley, where he found himself pursued by those debts of his
father which the Long Parliament had engaged to pay, and which
swallowed up more than his patrimony, though the manor of Merdon,
having been settled upon his wife, could not be touched.&nbsp; He
was sufficiently alarmed, however, to make him retreat to the
continent and change his name to Clarke.</p>
<p>In 1675 Mrs. Richard Cromwell died, leaving out of a numerous
family only one son and two daughters.&nbsp; The son, Oliver,
inherited the estates, and seems to have been on good terms with
his father, who, in 1700, came to live at Cheshunt under his name
of Clarke, and made some visits to Hursley.&nbsp; Richard married
under this assumed name, and left some children.</p>
<p>When Oliver died without heirs in 1706, his father Richard,
according to the original settlement, succeeded to the property,
but his two daughters set up their claim, and the case was
brought into court.&nbsp; It is said that the judge was Cowper,
but this has been denied.&nbsp; At any rate the judge seems to
have been shocked at the undutiful litigation, and treated the
old man with much respect.</p>
<p>The case was decided in his favour, and he lived between
Hursley and Cheshunt till his death in 1712 in his 86th year.</p>
<p>As Mr. Palgrave writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him count we wise,<br />
Him also, though the chorus of the throng<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be silent, though no pillar rise<br />
In slavish adulation of the strong,<br />
But here, from blame of tongues and fame aloof,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Neath a low chancel roof,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peace of God<br />
He sleeps; unconscious hero!&nbsp; Lowly grave<br />
By village footsteps daily trod;<br />
Unconscious! or while silence holds the nave,<br />
And the bold robin comes, when day is dim,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And pipes his heedless hymn.</p>

<p>These are a poet&rsquo;s meditations on him, more graceful
than the inscription on the monument erected to him by his two
undutiful daughters, ere, in 1718, they sold the estate.&nbsp; It
was a large tablet of marble, surmounted by death&rsquo;s
heads.&nbsp; It is of gray or veined marble, in the Doric style
of architecture, and is in height thirteen feet, and in breadth
nearly nine.&nbsp; The inscription upon it is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>This Monument was erected to the memory of Mrs.
Eliz. Cromwell, spinster (by Mr. Richard Cromwell and Thomas
Cromwell, her executors).&nbsp; She died the 8th day of April
1731, in the 82d yeare of her age, and lyes interred near this

Dorothy, his wife, who was the daughter of Richard Maijor,
Esq.&nbsp; And the following account of her family (all of whom,
except Mrs. Ann Gibson, lie in this chancel) is given according
to her desire.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ann Gibson, the 6th daughter, died 7th Dec. 1727, in the
69th year of her age, and lies interred, with Dr. Thomas Gibson,
her husband, Physician General of the Army, in the church-yard
belonging to St. George&rsquo;s Chapel, in London.</p>

<p>Oliver Cromwell, Esq., son of the said Richard Cromwell, died
11th May 1705, in the 49th year of his age.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dorothy Mortimer, a seventh daughter, wife of John
Mortimer, Esq., died 14th May 1681, in the 21st year of her age,
but left no issue.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The lime-trees, beautifully surrounding the churchyard, are
said to have been planted by Richard Cromwell, and there was
certainly an excellent fashion of planting them in the latter end
of the seventeenth century, partly due to a French custom, partly
to Evelyn&rsquo;s <i>Sylva</i>.&nbsp; The beautiful avenue of
limes at Brambridge, in three aisles, was probably planted at
this date by one of the Welles family.</p>
<p>In taking down the old lodge of Merdon or Hursley, a large
lump of metal was found, squeezed into a crevice of the wall, and
was sold by Mr. Heathcote as a Roman weight; but on being
cleaned, it proved to be the die of the seal of the
Commonwealth.&nbsp; Richard had caused a new seal to be made for
himself by Simon, a noted medallist, and he had probably thus
disposed of the die as a dangerous possession.&nbsp; Mr. Vertue
saw it in 1710, in the collection of a Mr. Roberts, but it has
since disappeared.</p>
<p>There was a stone inscribed to Edward Reynell and Mary his
wife, who died respectively in 1698 and 1699.&nbsp; They are
believed to have been friends of Oliver Cromwell the grandson,
who certainly named them in his will.&nbsp; There was a tradition
in Hursley that this Reynell was actually the executioner of King
Charles.</p>

53</span>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CUSTOMS OF THE MANOR OF MERDON</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> it was just at this time that
the customs of the manor of Merdon were revised, this seems to be
the fittest place for giving Mr. Marsh&rsquo;s summary of
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The quantity of land in cultivation within the Manor of
Merdon or parish of Hursley is, as I imagine, not less than
three-fifths of the whole, or about 6000 acres; of which the
greater part was anciently copyhold, under the Bishop and Church
of Winchester.&nbsp; The tenure by which it was held, was, and
indeed is still, that denominated <i>Borough English</i>, the
most singular custom of which is, that the <i>youngest</i> son
inherits the copyhold of his father, in preference of all his
elder brothers.&nbsp; The origin of this tenure, according to Sir
William Blackstone, is very remote, it being his opinion that it
was &lsquo;a remnant of Saxon liberty&rsquo;; <a
name="citation53"></a><a href="#footnote53"
class="citation">[53]</a> and was so named in contradistinction
to the Norman customs, afterwards introduced by the Conqueror,
from the Duchy of Normandy.&nbsp; The reasons commonly assigned
for the peculiar usage just mentioned are given by Blackstone,
but they are evidently not satisfactory to him, and, as it should
seem, not founded on truth.&nbsp; His own way of accounting for
it is far more rational and probable, though, it must be
confessed, it is only conjectural.&nbsp; He supposes that the
ancient inhabitants of this island were for the most part
herdsmen and shepherds; that their elder sons, as soon as they
arrived at manhood, received from their father a certain
allotment of cattle, and removed from him, and that the youngest
son, who continued to the last with him, became naturally the
heir of the family and of the remaining property.&nbsp; Whether
this were really the case or not will probably ever remain a
question of great uncertainty; and it is a circumstance of too
trifling a nature to deserve much investigation.&nbsp; It is,
however, worthy of remark that to this day this custom of descent
to the youngest son prevails among the Tartars; and that
something very like it was anciently the usage among most
northern nations. <a name="citation54"></a><a href="#footnote54"
class="citation">[54]</a>&nbsp; But whatever be its origin, or in
whatever way it be accounted for, such is the custom now existing
in this manor; and I have had frequent opportunities of observing
that it is held, especially by the inferior class of copyholders,
as sacred, and that they would, on no consideration, divert their
tenements out of the customary order of inheritance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But besides this custom, there are others also in this
manor which indicate great antiquity, and which, there can be but
little if any doubt, are the same as were in use before the
Norman Conquest.&nbsp; We are told, indeed, by Judge Blackstone,
that after that event the ancient Saxon system of tenure was laid
aside, and that the Normans, wherever they had lands granted to
them, introduced the feodal system; and that at length it was
adopted generally, and as constitutional, throughout the
kingdom.&nbsp; There does not, however, I think, appear to be
sufficient reason for supposing that this new system was received
into this manor, the customs here in use being evidently those of
a more remote age, and in their <i>circumstances</i>, if not in
their <i>nature</i>, altogether unlike those which were at this
time established by the Normans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under the feodal system, the tenant originally held his
lands entirely at the will of the lord, and at his death they
reverted to the lord again.&nbsp; The services to be performed
for the lord were uncertain and unlimited.&nbsp; The copyhold was
also subject to a variety of grievous taxes, which the lord had
the privilege, upon many occasions, of imposing&mdash;such as
aids, reliefs, primer seisin, wardship, escheats for felony and
want of heirs, and many more, altogether so exorbitant and
oppressive as often totally to ruin the tenant and rob him of
almost all interest in his property. <a name="citation56"></a><a
href="#footnote56" class="citation">[56]</a>&nbsp; The difference
of the circumstances under which the lands in the manor of Merdon
are, and, as it seems, always were held, is remarkably striking:
here the copyhold is hereditary, the services are certain and
limited, the fines are fixed and unchangeable, the lord has no
right of wardship, neither is the copyhold liable to escheat for
felony; the widow of a tenant has also a right of inheritance,
and the tenement may be let without the lord&rsquo;s consent for
a year.&nbsp; All which circumstances appear to bespeak an
original and fundamental difference of tenure from that of the
feodal system, and are, I presume, to be considered, not as
encroachments that have gradually grown upon that system, but as
being of a more liberal extraction and much greater antiquity. <a
name="citation57a"></a><a href="#footnote57a"
class="citation">[57a]</a>&nbsp; But besides these differences,
the supposition here advanced has this farther ground to rest
upon, viz. that neither the name of <i>Merdon</i>, nor that of
<i>Hursley</i>, is so much as mentioned in the great survey of
the kingdom, called Domesday-Book, which, if the intention of
that survey be rightly understood, <a name="citation57b"></a><a
href="#footnote57b" class="citation">[57b]</a> it seems next to a
certainty that one or other of them would have been had the new
system been here adopted.&nbsp; Nor, when it is considered that
this was <i>Church</i> property, and that in many instances the
alterations were not enforced, <a name="citation58"></a><a
href="#footnote58" class="citation">[58]</a> out of favour as it
is supposed to the landholder, who was partial to the more
ancient tenure, ought it to be thought extraordinary that the
customs in this manor did not undergo the general change; since,
if favour were desirable and shown to any, who were so likely to
expect and to find it as the clergy?&nbsp; But however this point
may really be, it appears evident that the tenants of this manor
have, from the earliest times to which we have the means of
resorting for information, enjoyed many unusual rights and
immunities, and that their services were, in many respects, far
from being so base and servile as those of the strictly feodal
tenant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When it was that disputes first arose between the lord
and tenants concerning their respective rights is not, I believe,
known with certainty; but it appears that in the time of Mr.
Maijor many of the lord&rsquo;s claims were complained of by the
tenants as usurpations; as, on the other hand, many of theirs
were by the lord as new and uncustomary.&nbsp; But it was in vain
then for the tenants either to resist the lord&rsquo;s
pretensions or to assert their own; such being Mr. Maijor&rsquo;s
power and interest with the Cromwellian Government as to enable
him, as they well knew, easily to defeat all their efforts.&nbsp;
In justice, however, to Mr. Maijor, it should be mentioned that
he acted, in one instance at least, with great liberality towards
the tenants; as by him it was that the customary personal
services were commuted for pecuniary payments&mdash;an exchange
which could not fail of being peculiarly acceptable to them, as
they were not only relieved by it from a service they considered
as a grievance, and performed reluctantly, but had the prospect
of being in the end great gainers by it.&nbsp; But though by this
concession on the part of the lord some ground of discontent was
removed, yet disputes and animosities still continued to subsist
with respect to other customs; and no sooner was Mr. Maijor dead,
and the Cromwell family dispossessed of its power, than the
tenants laid aside their fears and renewed their
opposition.&nbsp; The circumstances of the times being now in
their favour, it might perhaps have been expected that they, in
their turn, should establish all their claims without
contention.&nbsp; The case, however, was quite otherwise, as
neither Mrs. Cromwell nor her son would tamely forego any one of
their supposed privileges&mdash;on the contrary, Oliver defended
them in the true spirit of a Cromwell, and relinquished none but
such as the decisions of a jury, which were more than once
resorted to, deprived him of.&nbsp; In this state of strife and
litigation things continued until the year 1692, when most of the
principal tenants concurred in a determination to appeal to the
Court of Chancery.&nbsp; A bill of complaint was accordingly
presented to the Court, stating their supposed grievances, and
soliciting its interference.&nbsp; Several hearings and trials,
ordered in consequence of this application, for the investigation
of the disputed customs, then ensued; after which, though not
till more than six years had elapsed, the Court finally adjudged
and decreed the customs of the manor to be, and continue for the
future, as they here follow:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Custom</i> 1.&nbsp; That all the
copyholds and customary messuages, lands, and tenements within
the said manor are, and have been time out of mind, copyholds of

of Court Roll, according to the custom of the said manor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Custom</i> 2.&nbsp; That the customary tenements
within the said manor do descend, and ought to descend, as
tenements of the tenure, and in the nature of Borough-English,
not only to the youngest son or youngest daughter, and for
default of such issue of such customary tenant to the youngest
brother or youngest sister, but also, for default of such brother
and sister of such customary tenant, to the next kinsman or
kinswoman of the whole blood of the customary tenant in
possession, how far so ever remote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Custom</i> 3.&nbsp; That if any tenant of any
copyhold die, seized of any copyhold, his wife living, then she
ought to come to the next Court or Law-day to make her claim and
election, whether she will pay a penny and hold for her
widow&rsquo;s estate, or pay half her husband&rsquo;s fine, and
to keep the copyhold tenement during her life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Custom</i> 4.&nbsp; That the husband of any wife (as
customary tenant of the said manor) dying, seized of any

tenement was twenty shillings, the tenant of such tenement did
pay to the lord of the said manor forty shillings for a fine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Custom</i> 8.&nbsp; That every heir and tenant of
any customary lands of the said manor may sell his inheritance
during the life of the widow of his ancestor, who enjoys such
customary estate for life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Custom</i> 9.&nbsp; That it is lawful for any of the

<p>&ldquo;<i>Custom</i> 10. &lsquo;That no <i>certain</i> fine is

commons or wastes belonging to the said manor for earth or gravel
in the ancient pits there, where their predecessors have done,
for the improvement of their copyholds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Custom</i> 12.&nbsp; That all the customary tenants
of the said manor, when and as often as their old pits, where
they used to dig earth, marle, chalk, sand, clay, gravel, and
other mould, were deficient, and would not yield the same for
them, that they, the said customary tenants, may and have used to
dig <i>new</i> pits in any of the wastes and commons of the lord
within the said manor, and there dig and carry away earth, marle,
chalk, sand, clay, gravel, and other mould at their pleasure, for

necessary uses, without the licence of the lord of the said
manor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Custom</i> 13.&nbsp; That the ancient customary

<p>&ldquo;<i>Custom</i> 16.&nbsp; That the hazels, furzes,
maples, alders, wythies, crab-trees, fern, and bushes, growing
upon the aforesaid wastes and commons, or in either of them, as
also the acorns when they there fall, do belong to the customary
tenants of the said manor, not excluding the lord of the said

<p>The boundaries of the manor of Merdon, including Cranbury, and
up to the brook at Chandler&rsquo;s Ford, have been kept up by
&ldquo;progresses&rdquo; round them.&nbsp; Probably the
&ldquo;gang&rdquo; or Rogation procession was discontinued by
either Sir Philip Hobby or Richard Maijor; but on the borders
between Hursley and Baddesley, at a spot called High Trees
Corner, near the railway, is marked in the old map, &ldquo;Here
stode Gospell Oke.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is not far from Wool&rsquo;s
Grave, the next corner towards the Baddesley road.&nbsp; There,
no doubt, the procession halted for the reading of the Gospel for
Rogation week.</p>

<p>A small farm near the church was held by Corpus Christi
College, Oxford, having probably been granted by Bishop Richard
Fox, the founder, who held the See of Winchester from 1500 to
1528.&nbsp; The bearing in his coat of arms was a &ldquo;pelican
in her piety,&rdquo; and the Pelican was the name of the public
house and of the farm that succeeded it down to the present
day.&nbsp; The title as well as that of the college are of course
connected with the emblem of the Pelican feeding her young from
her own breast.&nbsp; Little pelicans, alternately with Tudor
portcullises, profusely adorn Fox&rsquo;s chantry in Winchester
Cathedral.</p>

69</span>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CRANBURY AND BRAMBRIDGE</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Great</span> changes began at the
Restoration.&nbsp; Robert Maunder became vicar of Hursley in
1660, on whose presentation is unknown; but that he or his curate
were scholars is probable, since the entries in the parish
registers both of Hursley and Otterbourne begin to be in
Latin.&nbsp; Cranbury had passed from Dean Young to his brother
Major General Young, and from him to his daughter, the wife or
Sir Charles Wyndham, son of Sir Edmund Wyndham, Knight Marshall
of England and a zealous cavalier.&nbsp; Brambridge, closely
bordering on Otterbourne, on the opposite side of the Itchen,
though in Twyford Parish, was in the possession of the Welles
family.&nbsp; Brambridge and Otterbourne are divided from one
another by the river Itchen, a clear and beautiful trout stream,
much esteemed by fishermen.&nbsp; In the early years of Charles
II. a canal was dug, beside the Itchen, for the conveyance of
coal from Southampton.&nbsp; It was one of the first formed in
England, and for two hundred years was constantly used by
barges.&nbsp; The irrigation of the meadows was also much
benefited, broad ditches being formed&mdash;&ldquo;water
carriages&rdquo; as they are locally called&mdash;which conduct
the streams in turn over the grass, so that even a dry season
causes no drought, but they always lie green and fresh while the
hills above are burnt brown.</p>
<p>Another work was set in hand during the reign of Charles II.,
namely the palace he designed to build in rivalry of
Versailles.&nbsp; Sir Christopher Wren was the architect.&nbsp;
The grounds were intended to stretch over the downs to a great
distance, and on the highest point was to stand a pharos, whose
light would be visible from the Solent.&nbsp; Fountains were to
be fed from the Itchen, and a magnificent palace was actually
begun, the bricks for it being dug from a clay pit at
Otterbourne, which has ever since borne the name of Dell Copse,
and became noted for the growth of daffodils.&nbsp; The king
lodged at Southampton to inspect the work, and there is a
tradition (derived from Dean Rennell) that being an excellent
walker, he went on foot to Winchester.&nbsp; One of his gentlemen
annoyed him by a hint to the country people as to who he was,
whereupon a throng come out to stare at him, at one of the
bridges.&nbsp; He escaped, and took his revenge by a flying leap
over a broad &ldquo;water carriage,&rdquo; leaving them to follow
as they could.</p>
<p>His death put an end to his design, when only one wing of the
building was completed.&nbsp; It was known as &ldquo;the
King&rsquo;s House&rdquo; and was used as barracks till 1892,
when it was unfortunately burnt to the ground.</p>
<p>Boyat, or Bovi&egrave;res, as it once was called, had been a
&ldquo;hundred,&rdquo; and was probably more of a village than at
present, since up to 1840 there was a pound and stocks opposite
to the single farm-house that remained.&nbsp; The lands stretched
from the hill to the river, near which was a hamlet called
Highbridge, just on the boundary between Twyford and
Otterbourne.&nbsp; Here was an endowed Roman Catholic chapel, a
mere brick building, at the back of a cottage, only distinguished
by a little cross on the roof.&nbsp; There is reason to think
that a good many dependants of the Brambridge family lived here,
for there are entries in the parish register that infants had
been born at Highbridge, but the curate of Otterbourne could not
tell whether they had been baptized.</p>
<p>A new parchment parish register was provided in 1690, and very
carefully kept by the curate, John Newcombe, who yearly showed it
up to the magistrates at the Petty Sessions, when it was signed
by two of them.&nbsp; A certain Augustin Thomas was a man of some
property, comprising a house and two or three fields, which were
known as &ldquo;Thomas&rsquo;s Bargain,&rdquo; till one was used
as a site for the Vicarage.&nbsp; Several surnames still extant
in the parish are found in the register, Cox, Comley, Collins,
Goodchild, Woods, Wareham&mdash;Anne and Abraham were the twin
children of John and Anne Diddams, a curious connection with the
name Didymus (twin), which seems to be the origin.</p>
<p>There must have been extensive repairs, if such they may be
called, of the church, probably under the influence of Sir
Charles and Lady Wyndham&mdash;for though Cranbury House stands
in Hursley parish, it is so much nearer to Otterbourne that the
inhabitants generally attend the church there,&mdash;and two huge
square pews in the chancel, one lined with red baize, the other
bare, were appropriated to Cranbury, and might well have been
filled by the children of Sir Charles and Dame James his
wife&mdash;Jacoba in her marriage register at Hursley&mdash;for
they had no less than seventeen children, of whom only five died
in infancy, a small proportion in those days of infant
mortality.&nbsp; The period of alteration is fixed by a great
square board bearing the royal arms, with the initials W. and M.
and the date 1687.&nbsp; No notice was taken of the Nassau
shield, and indeed it must have been put up in a burst of
enthusiasm for the glorious Revolution, for the lion, as best he
can be recollected, had a most exultant expression, with his
tongue out of one side of his mouth.</p>
<p>The black-letter Commandments on the chancel arch were
whitewashed out, and a tablet in blue with gold lettering erected
in their stead on each side of the altar.&nbsp; The east window
had either then or previously been deprived of all its tracery,
and was an expanse of plain glass with only a little remains of a
cusp at the top of the arch.&nbsp; The bells were in one of the
true Hampshire weather-boarded square towers, of which very few
still exist in their picturesqueness.&nbsp; There were the
remains of an old broken font, and a neat white marble one, of
which the tradition was that it was given by a parish clerk named
David Fidler, and it still exists as the lining of the present
font.</p>
<p>Sir Charles Wyndham died in 1706, his wife in 1720.&nbsp; A
small monument was raised for them in Hursley Church, with an
inscription on a tablet now in the tower, purporting that the
erection was by their daughters, Frances White and Beata
Hall.</p>
<p>Frances was married to a man of some note in his day, to judge
by the monument she erected to his memory in Milton Church, near
Lymington, where his effigy appears, an upright figure cut off at
the knees, and in addition to the sword in his hand there is a
metal one, with a blade waved like a Malay crease, by the side of
the monument.&nbsp; The inscription is thus&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Thomas White</span> Esq., son of<br />
<span class="smcap">Ignatius White</span> Esq. of Fiddleford in
Dorsetshire.</p>
<p>He served three kings and Queen Ann as a Commander in the
guards, and was much wounded.&nbsp; He was in the wars of Ireland
and Flanders.</p>
<p>He had one son who dyed before him.&nbsp; He departed this
life on the 17th of February in the year 1720.</p>
<p>This monument was erected by his widow Frances, one of the
daughters of Sir Charles Wyndham, in the county of
Southampton.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mrs. White thus lost her husband and her mother in the course
of the same year.&nbsp; Her brother sold the Cranbury property to
Jonathan Conduitt, Esquire, who was a noted person in his
day.&nbsp; He married Catherine Barton, the favourite niece and
adopted daughter of Sir Isaac Newton.&nbsp; It may be remembered
that this great man was a posthumous child, and was bred up by
his mother&rsquo;s second husband, Barnabas Smith, Rector of
North Witham, Lincolnshire, so as to regard her children as
brothers and sisters.&nbsp; Hannah Smith married one Thomas
Barton of Brigstock, and her daughter Catherine (whose name
mysteriously is found as suing for the price of property sold to
Charles II. for the site of the King&rsquo;s house at
Winchester), lived with Sir Isaac Newton, was very beautiful, and
much admired by Lord Halifax for her wit and gaiety.&nbsp; It was
even reported that she was privately married to him, but this of
course was mere scandal, and she became the wife of Jonathan
Conduitt, educated at Trinity College, a friend and pupil of
Newton, who had for many years assisted in the harder work of
Master of the Mint, and wrote an essay on the gold and silver
coinage of the realm.&nbsp; He was member of Parliament for
Southampton.&nbsp; Sir Isaac made his home with his niece and her
husband till his death in 1727, when Mr. Conduitt succeeded to
his office as Master of the Mint, and intended to write his life,
but was prevented by death in 1737.&nbsp; Among the materials
which Mr. Conduitt had preserved is the record of Newton&rsquo;s
saying, &ldquo;I do not know what I may appear to the world, but
to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea
shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother
pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, while the great ocean
of truth lay all undiscovered before me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A very curious relic of Sir Isaac survives in the garden at
Cranbury Park, viz. a sun-dial, said to have been calculated by
Newton.&nbsp; It is in bronze, in excellent preservation, and the
gnomon so perforated as to form the cypher I. C. seen either
way.&nbsp; The dial is divided into nine circles, the outermost
divided into minutes, next, the hours, then a circle marked
&ldquo;Watch slow, Watch fast,&rdquo; another with the names of
places shown when the hour coincides with our noonday, such as
Samarcand and Aleppo, etc., all round the world.&nbsp; Nearer the
centre are degrees, then the months divided into days.&nbsp;
There is a circle marked with the points and divisions of the
compass, and within, a diagram of the compass, the points
alternately plain and embossed.</p>
<p>There is no date, but the maker&rsquo;s name, John Rowley, and
the arms of Mr. Conduitt, as granted in 1717.&nbsp; Quarterly 1st
and 4th Gules, on a fesse wavy argent, between three pitchers
double eared or, as many bees volant proper.</p>
<p>2nd and 3rd Gules, a lion rampant argent between six acorns
or.&nbsp; Impaling argent 3 boars&rsquo; heads sable for
Barton.</p>
<p>Crest&mdash;Two Caducean rods with wings, lying fesse ways
or.&nbsp; Thereon a peacock&rsquo;s head, erased proper.</p>
<p>The motto&mdash;&ldquo;Cada uno es hijo de sus
obras.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Each one is son of his
deeds&rdquo;&mdash;translates the Spanish.</p>
<p>The 1st and 3rd quartering belongs to the old family of
Chenduite, from which Jonathan Conduitt may have been
descended.&nbsp; Probably he could not prove his right to their
Arms, and therefore had the fresh grant.</p>
<p>Mr. Conduitt died in 1737, leaving a daughter, whose guardians
sold Cranbury to Thomas Lee Dummer, Esquire, from whom it
descended in 1765 to his son of the same name.</p>
<p>Catherine Conduitt married the son of Viscount Lymington,
afterwards created Earl of Portsmouth.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE BUILDING AT HURSLEY</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the year 1718, Hursley was sold
by Cromwell&rsquo;s two surviving daughters for &pound;36,000 to
William Heathcote, Esq., afterwards created a baronet.</p>
<p>The Heathcotes belonged to a family of gentle blood in
Derbyshire.&nbsp; Gilbert Heathcote, one of the sons, was an
Alderman at Chesterfield, and was the common ancestor of the
Rutland as well as the Hursley family.&nbsp; His third son,
Samuel, spent some years as a merchant at Dantzic, where he made
a considerable fortune, and returning to England, married Mary
the daughter of William Dawsonne of Hackney.&nbsp; He was an
intimate friend of the great Locke, and assisted him in his work
on preserving the standard of the gold coin of the realm.&nbsp;
He died in 1708, his son William and brother Gilbert attained to
wealth and civic honours.</p>
<p>Sir Gilbert was Lord Mayor in 1711 and was the last who rode
in procession on the 9th of November.&nbsp; Both were Whigs,
though the Jacobite Lord Mayor, whose support was reckoned on by
the Stuarts, was their cousin.</p>
<p>At about twenty-seven years of age, William Heathcote married
Elizabeth, only daughter of Thomas Parker, Earl of Macclesfield,
and had in course of time six sons and three daughters.&nbsp; He
was M.P. first for Buckingham and afterwards for
Southampton.&nbsp; He was created a baronet in 1733.</p>

</a></p>
<p>There were plans drawn for enlarging the old lodge in which
the Hobbys and Cromwells had lived, but these seem to have been
found impracticable, and it was decided to pull the house down
and erect a new one on a different site.&nbsp; Tradition, and
Noble in his <i>Cromwell</i>, declared that the change was from
dislike of the Cromwell opinions and usurpations, but Mr. Marsh
considers this &ldquo;mean and illiberal&rdquo; and combats it
sharply.</p>
<p>The new and much more spacious building was placed a little
higher up on the hill, with a wide bowling-green on the south
side, where in dry summers the old foundations of the former
house can be traced, the walnut avenues leading up to it.&nbsp;
The house was in the style that is now called Queen Anne, of red
brick quoined with stone, with large-framed heavy sash windows
and double doors to each of the principal rooms, some of which
were tapestried with Gobelin arras representing the four
elements&mdash;Juno, with all the elements of the air; Ceres
presiding over the harvest, for the earth; Vulcan with the
emblems of fire; and Amphitrite drawn by Tritons personifying
water.</p>
<p>There was then a great central entrance-hall, in the middle of
the northern side of the house, with stone steps going up at each
end, outside, but, as we see from drawings and prints of the
time, with no carriage-approach to the house, so that people must
have driven up to the front door over the grass.</p>
<p>Sir William died in 1751, fifty-eight years old.&nbsp; His
son, Sir Thomas, born in 1721, was the builder of old Hursley
Church, which was begun in 1752, and completed the next year,
only the tower being left of the former edifice.&nbsp; In 1808
some few capitals of the old pillars remained in parts of the
village, and were adjudged by Mr. Marsh to be Saxon.&nbsp; It was
said that the inside was very dark, the ground outside being
nearly on a level with the windows, and six or eight steps
descending to the floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>It was all swept away, and the new structure was pronounced by
Mr. Marsh to be exceedingly &ldquo;neat, light, and
airy.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was 82 feet long, and 49 broad, with two
aisles, and an arched ceiling, supported on pillars.&nbsp; It
might well be light, for the great round-headed windows were an
expanse of glass, very glaring in sunshine, though mitigated by
the waving lime-trees.&nbsp; The plan and dimensions followed
those of the old church, and were ample enough, the north aisle a
good deal shorter than the chancel, and all finished with gables
crow-stepped in the Dutch fashion.&nbsp; It was substantially
paved within, and was a costly and anxiously planned achievement
in the taste of the time, carefully preserving all the older
monuments.&nbsp; A mausoleum in the same style was built for the
Heathcote family in the south-western corner of the churchyard,
and gradually the white-washed walls of the church became
ornamented (?) with the hatchments of each successive baronet and
his wife, the gentlemen&rsquo;s shields with the winged globe as
crest, and the motto <i>Deus prosperat justos</i>; the
ladies&rsquo; lozenge finished with a death&rsquo;s head above,
and <i>Resurgam</i> below.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas was twice married and had eight children.&nbsp; He
died at sixty-five years of age on 29th of June 1787.&nbsp; He
was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Sir William, who was
born in 1746, and was member for the county in three
Parliaments.&nbsp; He was a man of great integrity, humanity, and
charity, very affable and amiable, and unassuming in his manners,
&ldquo;and he died as he had lived, fearing God.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
married Frances, daughter and co-heiress of John Thorpe of
Embley, and had seven children.</p>
<p>His eldest son, Sir Thomas, married the heiress of Thomas
Edwards Freeman, of Batsford, Gloucestershire, in 1799, and was
known as Sir Thomas Freeman Heathcote.&nbsp; He was member for
the county from 1808 till 1820, when he retired.&nbsp; He is
reported to have known an old man who said he had held a gate
open for Oliver Cromwell, but this must have meant the grandson,
who died in 1705.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas died without issue in his fifty-sixth year on the
21st day of February 1825.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">OLD OTTERBOURNE</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas Dummer</span>, Esquire, who in 1765
succeeded his father in the possession of Cranbury, was a man to
whom some evil genius whispered, &ldquo;Have a taste,&rdquo; for
in 1770 he actually purchased the City Cross of Winchester to set
it up at Cranbury, but happily the inhabitants of the city were
more conservative than their corporation, and made such a
demonstration that the bargain was annulled, and the Cross left
in its proper place.&nbsp; He consoled himself with erecting a
tall lath and plaster obelisk in its stead, which was regarded
with admiration by the children of the parish for about sixty
years, when weather destroyed it.</p>
<p>He also transported several fragments from Netley Abbey, which
formed part of his property at Weston near Southampton, and set
them up in his park as an object from the windows.&nbsp; There is
an arch, the base of a pillar, and a bit of gateway tower, but no
one has been able to discover the part whence they came, so that
not much damage can have been done.&nbsp; The rear of the gateway
has been made into a keeper&rsquo;s lodge, and is known to the
village of Otterbourne as &ldquo;the Castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He is also said to have had a kind of menagerie, and to have
been once in danger from either a bear or a leopard; the man at
Hursley who rescued him did not seem in his old age to be clear
which it was, though he considered himself to have a claim on the
property.</p>
<p>It would not have been easy to substantiate it, for Mr. Dummer
died without heirs about 1790, leaving his property at Cranbury
and Netley first to his widow, and after her to the Chamberlayne
family.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dummer lived many years after her husband, and married an
artist, then of some note, Sir Nathanael Dance, who assumed the
name of Holland, and in 1800 was created a baronet.&nbsp; He
threw up painting as a profession, but brought several good
pictures to Cranbury.&nbsp; His wife survived him till
1823&ndash;24, when William Chamberlayne, M.P. for Southampton,
came into the property, and from him, in 1829, it descended to
his nephew, Thomas Chamberlayne, Esquire.</p>
<p>Brambridge had a more eventful history.&nbsp; From the
Welleses, it passed to the Smythes, also Roman Catholics.&nbsp;
Walter Smythe, the first of these, was second son of Sir John
Smythe of Acton Burnell in Derbyshire.&nbsp; His daughter Mary
Anne was married at nineteen to one of the Welds of Lulworth
Castle, who died within a year, and afterwards to Thomas
Fitzherbert, who left her a childless widow before she was
twenty-five.</p>
<p>It was six years later that, after vehement passionate
entreaties on the part of George, Prince of Wales, and even a
demonstration of suicide, she was wrought upon to consent to a
private marriage with him, which took place on the 21st of
December 1785, at her house in Park Lane, the ceremony being
performed by a clergyman of the Church of England, in the
presence of her uncle and one of her brothers.</p>
<p>So testifies Jesse in his <i>Life of George III</i>.&nbsp;
Nevertheless there is at Twyford a belief that the wedding took
place at midnight in the bare little Roman Catholic Chapel at
Highbridge, and likewise in Brambridge House, where the vicar
officiated and was sworn to secrecy.&nbsp; The register, it is
said, was deposited at Coutts&rsquo;s Bank under a lock with four
keys.&nbsp; The connection with Twyford was kept up while the
lady lived, but no one remains who can affirm the facts.&nbsp;
Her first marriage, in early youth, was most probably, as
described, at Brambridge.&nbsp; Her very small wedding ring is
also extant, but neither ring nor ceremony can belong to her
royal marriage.&nbsp; It would be curious that the adjoining
parish of Marwell likewise had to boast (if that is a right word)
of Henry VIII.&rsquo;s marriage with Jane Seymour.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fitzherbert certainly visited Brambridge, for an old
gardener named Newton, and Miss Frances Mary Bargus, who came to
live at Otterbourne in 1820, remembered her, and the latter noted
her fine arched brows.&nbsp; George IV.&rsquo;s love for her was
a very poor thing, but she was the only woman he ever had any
real affection for, and he desired that her miniature should be
buried with him.</p>
<p>She survived him for many years, and died in 1837 at
eighty-one years old.</p>
<p>Her brother Walter was one of the English who visited Paris
and was made prisoner by Napoleon I. at the rupture of the peace
of Amiens, and detained till 1814.&nbsp; While he was a prisoner,
his brother Charles caused all the limes in the avenue at
Brambridge to be pollarded, and sold the tops for gun
stocks.&nbsp; Nevertheless the trees are still magnificent,
making three aisles, all the branches inwards rising up
perpendicularly, those without sweeping gracefully down, and all
budding and fading simultaneously.&nbsp; The pity is that the
modern house should not have been built at one end or the other,
so that they form actually a passage that leads to nothing.&nbsp;
Since his death, the property has been sold, and has passed into
strangers&rsquo; hands.&nbsp; The endowment of the chapel has
been transferred to one at Eastleigh, and the house to which it
was attached belongs to a market garden.</p>
<p>The two parishes were near enough to the coast to be kept in
anxiety by the French schemes for landing.&nbsp; The tenant of
the Winchester College property at Otterbourne is said to have
kept all her goods packed up, and to have stirred the fire with a
stick all through one winter; and as late as between
1840&ndash;50, Mr. Bailey of Hursley still had in his barn the
seats that had been prepared to fit into the waggons that were to
carry the women into the downs in the event of a battle.</p>
<p>The Rev. John Marsh, who in 1808 collected the memoranda of
Hursley and dedicated them to Sir William Heathcote, was curate
of Hursley and incumbent of Baddesley.&nbsp; The Vicar was the
Rev. Gilbert Heathcote, fifth son of Sir Thomas, second
Baronet.&nbsp; He was afterwards Archdeacon of Winchester and a
Canon of Winchester.&nbsp; He was a man of great musical talent,
and some of his chants are still in use.&nbsp; The only other
fact recollected of him was, that being told that he used hard
words in his sermons, he asked a labourer if he knew what was
meant by Predestination, and was answered, &ldquo;Yes, sir,
some&rsquo;at about the innards of a pig.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
generally resided there.&nbsp; Mr. Marsh remained curate of
Hursley and was presented to the living of Baddesley.&nbsp; All
this time Otterbourne had only one Sunday service, alternately
matins or evensong, and the church bell was rung as soon as the
clergyman could be espied riding down the lane.&nbsp; Old customs
so far survived that the congregation turned to the east in the
Creed, always stood up, if not sooner, when
&ldquo;Alleluia&rdquo; occurred at the end of the very peculiar
anthems, and had never dropped the response, &ldquo;Thanks be to
Thee, O Lord,&rdquo; at the end of the Gospel.</p>
<p>The Holy Communion was celebrated four times a year, 35. 7d.
being paid each time for the Elements, as is recorded in
beautiful writing in &ldquo;the Church Raiting book,&rdquo; which
began to be kept in 1776.&nbsp; &ldquo;Washan the surples&rdquo;
before Easter cost 4s.; a Communion cloth, tenpence; and for
washing and marking it, sixpence.&nbsp; A new bell cost &pound;
5: 5: 10, and its &ldquo;carridge&rdquo; from London 11s.
10d.&nbsp; Whitewashing the church came to &pound;1: 1s., and
work in the gallery to 10s. 4d.&nbsp; Besides, there was a
continual payment for dozens of <i>sprow</i> heads, also for fox
heads at threepence apiece, for a badger&rsquo;s head, a
&ldquo;poul cat,&rdquo; marten cats, and hedgehogs.&nbsp; These
last, together with sparrows, continue to appear till 1832, when
the Rev. Robert Shuckburgh, in the vestry, protested against such
use of the church rate, and it was discontinued.&nbsp; Mr.
Shuckburgh was the first resident curate at Otterbourne, being
appointed by the Archdeacon.&nbsp; He was the first to have two
services on Sunday, though still the ante-Communion service was
read from the desk, and he there pulled off his much iron-moulded
surplice from over his gown and ascended the pulpit stair.&nbsp;
The clerk limped along the aisle to the partitioned space in the
gallery to take part in the singing.</p>
<p>But changes were beginning.&nbsp; The direct coaching road
between Winchester and Southampton had been made, and many houses
had followed it.&nbsp; The road that crosses Colden Common and
leads to Portsmouth was also made about the same time, and was
long called Cobbett&rsquo;s road, from that remarkable
self-taught peasant reformer, William Cobbett, who took part in
planning the direction.</p>
<p>Cobbett was a friend of Mr. Harley, a retired tradesman who
bought the cottage that had belonged to a widow, named Science
Dear, and enlarged it.&nbsp; Several American trees were planted
in the ground by Cobbett, of which only one survives, a hickory,
together with some straggling bushes of robinia, which Cobbett
thought would make good hedges, being very thorny, and throwing
up suckers freely, but the branches proved too brittle to be
useful.&nbsp; About 1819 Mr. Harley sold his house and the
paddock adjoining to Mary Bargus, widow of the Rev. Thomas
Bargus, Vicar of Barkway in Hertfordshire, and she came to live
there with her daughter Frances Mary.&nbsp; In 1622, Miss Bargus
married William Crawley Yonge, youngest son of the Rev. Duke
Yonge, Vicar of Cornwood, Devon, of the old family of Yonges of
Puslinch.&nbsp; He then retired from the 52nd regiment, in which
he had taken part in the Pyrenean battles, and in those of Orthez
and Toulouse, and had his share in the decisive charge which
completed the victory of Waterloo.&nbsp; They had two children,
Charlotte Mary, born August 11th, 1823, and Julian Bargus, born
January 31st, 1830.</p>
<h2><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CHURCH BUILDING</span></h2>
<p>A <span class="smcap">new</span> era began in both Hursley and
Otterbourne with the accession of Sir William Heathcote, the
fifth baronet, and with the marriage of William Yonge.</p>
<p>Sir William was born on the 17th of May 1801, the son of the
Rev. William Heathcote, Rector of Worting, Hants, and Prebendary
of the Cathedral of Winchester, second son of Sir William, third
baronet.&nbsp; His mother was Elizabeth, daughter of Lovelace
Bigg Wither of Manydown Park in the same county.&nbsp; She was
early left a widow, and she bred up her only son with the most
anxious care.&nbsp; She lived chiefly at Winchester, and it may
be interesting to note that her son remembered being at a
Twelfth-day party where Jane Austen drew the character of Mrs.
Candour, and assumed the part with great spirit.</p>
<p>He was sent first to the private school of considerable
reputation at Ramsbury in Wiltshire, kept by the Rev. Edward
Meyrick, and, after four years there, became a commoner at
Winchester College, where it is said that he and Dr. William
Sewell were the only boys who jointly retarded the breaking out
of the rebellion against Dr. Gabell, which took place after their
departure.&nbsp; However, in April 1818 he left Winchester, and
became a commoner of Oriel College, Oxford, where his tutor was
the Rev. John Keble, only eight years older than himself, and not
yet known to fame, but with an influence that all who came in
contact with him could not fail to feel.</p>
<p>In 1821 Mr. Heathcote gained a First-class in his B.A.
examination, and was elected Fellow of All Souls in November
1822.&nbsp; He began to read at the Temple, but in April 1825 he
came into the property of his uncle, and in the November of the
same year he married the Hon. Caroline Frances Perceval, the
youngest daughter of Charles George Lord Arden.&nbsp; Both he and
his wife were deeply religious persons, with a strong sense of
the duties of their station.&nbsp; Education and influence had
done their best work on a character of great rectitude and
uprightness, even tending to severity, such as softened with
advancing years.&nbsp; Remarkably handsome, and with a high-bred
tone of manners, he was almost an ideal country gentleman, with,
however, something of stiffness and shyness in early youth, which
wore off in later years.&nbsp; In 1826 he became member for the
county on the Tory interest.</p>
<p>As a landlord, he is remembered as excellent.&nbsp; His mother
took up her abode at Southend House in Hursley parish, and under
the auspices of the Heathcote family, and of the Misses Marsh,
daughters of the former curate, Sunday and weekday schools were
set on foot, the latter under Mrs. Ranger and her daughter, whose
rule continued almost to the days of national education.&nbsp;
One of his first proceedings was to offer the living of Hursley
to the Rev. John Keble, who had spent a short time there as
curate in 1826.&nbsp; It was actually accepted, when the death of
a sister made his presence necessary to his aged father at
Fairford in Gloucestershire; and for two years, during which the
publication of the <i>Christian Year</i> took place, he remained
in charge of a small parish adjacent to his home.</p>
<p>About 1824 Mrs. Yonge began to keep the first Sunday school at
Otterbourne in a hired room, teaching the children, all girls,
chiefly herself, and reading part of the Church Service to them
at the times when it was not held at church.&nbsp; The only
week-day school was on the hill, kept by a picturesque old dame,
whose powers amounted to hindering the children from getting into
mischief, but who&mdash;with the instinct Mrs. Charles
describes&mdash;never forgave the advances that disturbed her
monopoly.</p>
<p>In 1826, as Mrs. Yonge was looking at the empty space of a
roadway that had led into the paddock before it became a lawn,
she said, &ldquo;How I should like to build a school
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said her mother, Mrs. Bargus, &ldquo;you
shall have what I can give.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Yonge contrived the room built of cement, with two tiny
ones behind for kitchen and bedroom for the mistress, and a brick
floor; and the first mistress, Mrs. Creswick, was a former
servant of Archdeacon Heathcote&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>She was a gentle woman, with dark eyes and a lame leg, so that
she could not walk to church with the children, who sat on low
benches along the nave, under no discipline but the long stick
Master Oxford, the clerk, brandished over them.&nbsp; Nor could
she keep the boys in any order, and the big ones actually kicked
a hole nearly through the cement wall behind them.&nbsp; At last,
under the sanction of the Rev. Gilbert Wall Heathcote, who had
succeeded his father as Vicar of Hursley, a rough cast room was
erected in the churchyard, where Master Oxford kept school, with
more upright goodness than learning; and Mr. Shuckburgh, the
curate, and Mr. Yonge had a Sunday school there.</p>
<p>The riots at the time of the Reform Bill did not greatly
affect the two parishes, though a few villagers joined the bands
who went about asking for money at the larger houses.&nbsp;
George, Sir William&rsquo;s second son, told me that he
remembered being locked into the strong room on some alarm, but
whether it came actually to the point of an attack is a
question.&nbsp; It was also said that one man at Otterbourne hid
himself in a bog, that the rioters might not call upon him; and
one other man, James Collins, went about his work as usual, and
heard nothing of any rising.</p>
<p>One consequence of the riotous state of the country was the
raising of troops of volunteer yeomanry cavalry.&nbsp; Charles
Shaw Lefevre, Esq. (afterwards Speaker and Lord Eversley), was
colonel, Sir William was major and captain of such a troop, Mr.
Yonge a captain; but at one of the drills in Hursley Park a
serious accident befell Sir William.&nbsp; His horse threw back
its head, and gave him a violent blow on the forehead, which
produced concussion of the brain.&nbsp; He was long in
recovering, and a slight deafness in one ear always remained.</p>
<p>In 1835 a far greater trouble fell on him in the death of the
gentle Lady Heathcote, leaving him three sons and a
daughter.&nbsp; In the midst of his grief, he was able to bring
his old friend and tutor nearer to him.&nbsp; Mr. Keble at the
funeral gave him the poem, as yet unpublished,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">I thought to meet no
more,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which had been written after the funeral of his own sister,
Mary Anne Keble.&nbsp; The elder Mr. Keble died in the course of
the same year, and Mr. Gilbert Wall Heathcote, resigning the
living to become a fellow of Winchester, it was again given to
the Rev. John Keble.&nbsp; Mr. Heathcote had brought to
Otterbourne a young Fellow of New College, a deacon just
twenty-three, the Reverend William Bigg Wither, who came for six
weeks and remained thirty-five years.&nbsp; He found only twelve
Communicants in the parish, and left seventy!</p>
<p>Mr. Keble was already known and revered as the author of the
<i>Christian Year</i>, and was Professor of Poetry at Oxford,
when he came to Hursley; having married, on the 10th of October
1835, Charlotte Clarke, the most perfect of helpmeets to pastor
or to poet, save only in the frailness of her health.</p>
<p>He had two years previously preached at Oxford the assize
sermon on National Apostasy, which Newman marks as the beginning
of the awakening of the country to church doctrine and
practice.&nbsp; He and his brother were known as contributors to
the <i>Tracts for the Times</i>, which were rousing the clergy in
the same direction, but which were so much misunderstood, and
excited so much obloquy, that Mr. Norris of Hackney, himself a
staunch old-fashioned churchman, who had held up the light in
evil times, said to his young friend, the Rev. Robert Francis
Wilson, a first-class Oriel man, to whom the curacy of Hursley
had been offered, &ldquo;Now remember if you become Keble&rsquo;s
curate, you will lose all chance of preferment for
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>Mr. Wilson, though a man of much talent, was willing to accept
the probability, which proved a correct augury.</p>
<p>The new state of things was soon felt.&nbsp; Daily Services
and monthly Eucharists, began; and the school teaching and
cottage visiting were full of new life.&nbsp; Otterbourne had,
even before Mr. Keble&rsquo;s coming, begun to feel the need of a
new church.&nbsp; The population was 700, greatly overflowing the
old church, so that the children really had to be excluded when
the men were there.&nbsp; It was also at an inconvenient distance
from the main body of the inhabitants, who chiefly lived along
the high road.&nbsp; Moreover, the South Western Railway was
being made, and passed so near, that to those whose ears were
unaccustomed to the sound of trains, it seemed as if the noise
would be a serious interruption to the service.</p>
<p>Mr. Yonge had begun to take measures for improving and
enlarging the old church, but was recommended to wait for the
appointment of the new incumbent.&nbsp; Mr. Keble threw himself
heartily into the scheme, and it was decided that it would be far
better to change the site of the church at once.&nbsp; The
venerable Dr. Routh, who was then President of St. Mary Magdalen
College, and used yearly to come on progress to the old manor
house, the Moat House, to hold his court, took great interest in
the project, and the college gave an excellent site on the
western slope of the hill, with the common crossed by the high
road in front, and backed by the woods of Cranbury Park.&nbsp;
Also a subscription of large amount was given.&nbsp; Sir William
Heathcote as patron, as well as Mr. Keble, contributed largely,
and Mr. Bigg Wither gave up his horse, and presented &pound;25
out of each payment he received as Fellow of New College.&nbsp;
Other friends also gave, and, first and last, about &pound;3000
was raised.</p>
<p>Church building was much more difficult in those days than in
these.&nbsp; Ecclesiastical architecture had scarcely begun to
revive, and experts were few, if any indeed deserved the
title.&nbsp; An architect at Winchester, Mr. Owen Carter, was
employed, but almost all the ideas, and many of the drawings of
the details came from Mr. Yonge, who started with merely the
power of military drawing (acquired before he was sixteen years
old) and a great admiration for York Cathedral.</p>
<p>The cruciform plan was at once decided on (traced out at first
with a stick on Cranbury grand drive), but the slope of the
ground hindered it from being built duly east and west; the
material is brick, so burnt as to be glazed grey on one
side.&nbsp; Hearing of a church (Corstan, Wiltshire) with a
bell-turret likely to suit the means and the two bells, Mr. Yonge
and Mr. Wither rode to see it, and it was imitated in the
design.&nbsp; The chancel was, as in most of the new churches
built at this time, only deep enough for the sanctuary, as
surpliced choirs had not been thought possible in villages, and
so many old chancels had been invaded by the laity that it was an
object to keep them out.</p>
<p>Mr. Yonge sought diligently for old patterns and for ancient
carving in oak, and in Wardour Street he succeeded in obtaining
five panels, representing the Blessed Virgin and the four Latin
Fathers, which are worked into the pulpit; also an exceedingly
handsome piece of carving, which was then adapted as
altar-rail&mdash;evidently Flemish&mdash;with scrolls containing
corn and grapes, presided over by angels, and with two groups of
kneeling figures; on one side, apparently an Emperor with his
crown laid down, and the collar of the Golden Fleece around his
neck, followed by a group of male figures, one with a beautiful
face.&nbsp; On the other side kneels a lady, not an empress, with
a following of others bringing flowers.&nbsp; At the divisions
stand Religious of the four Orders, one a man.&nbsp; The idea is
that it probably represents either the coronation of Maximilian
or the abdication of Charles V.&nbsp; In either case there was no
wife, but the crown is not imperial, and that is in favour of
Maximilian.&nbsp; On the other hand the four monastic Orders are
in favour of Charles V.&rsquo;s embracing the religious life.</p>
<p>For the stone-work, Mr. Yonge discovered that the material
chiefly used in the cathedral was Caen stone, though the
importation had long ceased.&nbsp; He entered into communication
with the quarrymen there, sent out a stone mason (Newman) from
Winchester, and procured stone for the windows, reredos, and
font, thus opening a traffic that has gone on ever since.</p>

<p>Mistakes were made from ignorance and lack of authoritative
precedent, before ecclesiology had become a study; but whatever
could be done by toil, intelligence, and self-devotion was done
by Mr. Yonge in those two years; and the sixty years that have
since elapsed have seen many rectifications of the various
errors.&nbsp; Even as the church stood when completed, it was
regarded as an effort in the right direction, and a good example
to church builders.&nbsp; The first stone was laid in
Whitsun-week 1837 by Julian Bargus, Mr. Yonge&rsquo;s
five-year-old son.&nbsp; A school for the boys was built on a
corner of the ground intended as churchyard, and a larger room
added to the girls&rsquo;, the expense being partly defrayed by a
bazaar held at Winchester, and in part by Charlotte Yonge&rsquo;s
first book, <i>The Ch&acirc;teau de Melville</i>, which people
were good enough to buy, though it only consisted of French
exercises and translations.&nbsp; The consecration took place on
the 30th of July 1838, and immediately after daily matins were
commenced.&nbsp; So that the Church of St. Matthew has never in
sixty years been devoid of the voice of praise, except during
casual absences.&nbsp; Most of the trees in the churchyard were
planted by Mr. Bigg Wither, especially the great Sequoia, and the
holly hedge around was grown by him from the berries of the first
Christmas decoration, which he sowed in a row under the wall of
the boys&rsquo; school, and transplanted when large enough.</p>
<p>It was in 1839 that Mr. Keble published his Oxford Psalter, a
work he had been engaged on for years, paying strict and reverent
attention to the Hebrew original, and not thinking it right to
interweave expressions of his own as guidance to meaning.&nbsp;
His belief was that Holy Scripture is so many-sided, and so
fathomless in signification, that to dwell on one point more than
another might be a wrong to the full impression, and an
irreverence in the translation.&nbsp; Thus, as a poet, he
sacrificed a good deal to the duty of being literal, but his
translation is a real assistance to students, and it is on the
whole often somewhat like to Sternhold&rsquo;s, whom he held in
much respect for his adherence to the originals.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may be mentioned here that the parishes of Hursley
and Otterbourne were in such good order under the management of
Sir William Heathcote and Mr. Yonge, that under the new Poor Law
they were permitted to form a small Union of four, afterwards
five, and now six parishes.</p>
<p>Ampfield was a hamlet lying on the western side of Hursley
Park and wood, a very beautiful wood in parts, of oak and beech
trees, which formed lovely vaulted arcades, one of which Mr.
Keble used to call Hursley Cathedral.&nbsp; The place was
increasing in population, and nearly two miles of woodland and
park lay between it and the parish church.</p>
<p>Sir William Heathcote, therefore, resolved to build a church
for the people, and Mr. Yonge was again the architect and clerk
of the works, profiting by the experience gained at Otterbourne,
so as to aim at Early English rather than Decorated style.&nbsp;
A bell turret, discovered later at Leigh Delamere in Wiltshire,
was a more graceful model than that of Corston.&nbsp; The
situation was very beautiful, cut out, as it were, of the pine
plantation on a rising ground above the road to Romsey, so that
when the first stone was laid by Gilbert Vyvyan, Sir
William&rsquo;s third son, the Psalm, &ldquo;Lo, we heard of the
same at Ephrata, and found it in the wood,&rdquo; sounded most
applicable.&nbsp; St. Mark was the saint of the dedication, which
fell opportunely on 21st April 1841, very near Mr. Keble&rsquo;s
birthday, St. Mark&rsquo;s day, and to many it was a specially
memorable day, as the Rev. J. H. Newman was present with his
sister, Mrs. Thomas Mozley, and her husband, then vicar of
Cholderton; and the Rev. Isaac Williams, a sacred poet, whose
writings ought to be better known than they are, was also
present.&nbsp; The endowment was provided by the chapter of
Winchester giving up the great tithes, and a subscription of
which T. White, Esq. of Ampfield gave &pound;500.</p>
<p>The Rev. Robert Francis Wilson was the first curate, being
succeeded in the curacy of Hursley by the Rev. Peter Young, then
a deacon, who inhabited the old vicarage.&nbsp; The present one,
which had been built by Sir Thomas Freeman Heathcote, was made
over to the living by Sir William some years later.</p>
<p>Immediately after the consecration, Sir William was married to
Selina, daughter of Evelyn John Shirley, Esq., of Eatington,
Warwickshire, a marriage occasioning great happiness and benefit
to all the parish and neighbourhood.</p>

107</span>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="GutSmall">HURSLEY CHURCH</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> one of his prose writings Mr.
Keble speaks of the faithful shepherd going on his way though
storms may be raging in the atmosphere; and such might be a
description of his own course as regarded his flock, though there
were several of these storms that affected him deeply.&nbsp; One
gust came very near home.</p>
<p>The diocesan, Bishop Charles Sumner, was an excellent and
conscientious man, with a much deeper sense of his duties as a
bishop than his immediate predecessors, and of great kindness and
beneficence; but he had been much alarmed and disturbed by the
alleged tendencies of the <i>Tracts for the Times</i>, and shared
in the desire of most of the authorities to discourage their
doctrines and practice.&nbsp; When, therefore, the curate of
Hursley came to Farnham to be admitted to the priesthood, he was
required, contrary to the usual custom with candidates, to state
categorically his views upon the Holy Eucharist.&nbsp; He used
the expressions of the Catechism, also those of Bishop Ridley,
but was desired to use his own individual words; and when these
were sent in, he was rejected, though they did not outrun the
doctrine that had always been taught by the close followers of
the doctrine of the Catechism.&nbsp; Nevertheless, in spite of
this disapproval, there was no withdrawal of his licence, and he
remained at Hursley, not thinking it loyal to seek Ordination
from another bishop, as would readily have been granted.&nbsp; He
married Mrs. Keble&rsquo;s cousin, Miss Caroline Coxwell, and
their young family was an infinite source of delight to the
childless vicarage.</p>
<p>Their baby ways, to one who held that &ldquo;where christened
infants sport, the floor is holy,&rdquo; and who read a mystical
meaning into many of their gestures and words, were a constant
joy and inspiration; and there grew up a store of poems upon them
and other little ones, especially the children of Dr. George
Moberly, then headmaster of Winchester College (later bishop of
Salisbury).&nbsp; These Mr. Keble thought of putting together for
publication, being chiefly impelled to do so by the desire to
improve Hursley Church, the eighteenth century arrangement of
which really prevented the general inculcation of the more
reverent observances which teach and imply doctrine.</p>
<p>In consideration of the feelings of certain old parishioners,
and the other more pressing needs, as well as of the patience
with which so great an enterprise needed in his mind to be
contemplated, nine years had elapsed since his incumbency had
begun before he wrote: &ldquo;We are stirring about our Church,
and next spring I hope really to go to work; you must come and
see the plans first, or else hereafter for ever hold your peace
in respect of alleging impediments.&nbsp; One feels that
one&rsquo;s advanced age has not rendered one fitted to set about
such works; but really the irreverence and other mischiefs caused
by the present state of Hursley Church seem to leave one no
choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The step that had first been taken was one for which many
generations far and wide have reason to be grateful, the
arrangement and publication of the <i>Lyra Innocentium</i>, to a
certain degree on the lines of the <i>Christian Year</i>, so as
to have one poem appropriated to each Sunday and holy day (though
these were only fully marked off in a later edition).</p>
<p>The book is perhaps less universally read than the
<i>Christian Year</i>, and is more unequal, some poems rising
higher and into greater beauty, some deeper and showing that the
soul had made further progress in these twenty years, some very
simple in structure, fit for little children, yet with a grave
and solemn thought in the last verse.</p>
<p>Those that are specially full of Hursley atmosphere, on events
connected with the author, may be touched on here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christmas Eve Vespers&rdquo; was suggested by the
schoolmaster&rsquo;s little daughter going into church before the
decoration had been put up, and exclaiming, disappointed,
&ldquo;No Christmas!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The Second Sunday in
Lent&rdquo; recalls, in the line on &ldquo;the mimic rain on
poplar leaves,&rdquo; the sounds made by a trembling aspen, whose
leaves quivered all through the summer evenings, growing close to
the house of Mr. Keble&rsquo;s life-long friend and biographer,
Sir John Taylor Coleridge, at Ottery St. Mary.&nbsp; An engraving
of Raffaelle&rsquo;s last picture &ldquo;The
Transfiguration&rdquo; hung in the Vicarage drawing-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Fourth Sunday in Lent,&rdquo; on the offering of
the lad with the five loaves, was suggested by the stained window
on that subject given by the young Marquess of Lothian&mdash;a
pupil for some years of Mr. Wilson at Ampfield&mdash;to the
church at Jedburgh, built by his mother.&nbsp; Now that he has
passed away, it may be remarked that he, as well as all the
children commemorated in these poems, grew up so as to leave no
painful impression connected with them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Keep thou,
dear boy, thine early vow,&rdquo; was fulfilled in him, as it was
with George Herbert Moberly, the eldest son of Dr. Moberly, who,
when a young child staying at the vicarage, was unconsciously the
cause of the poems &ldquo;Loneliness&rdquo; and &ldquo;Repeating
the Creed,&rdquo; for Easter Sunday and Low Sunday.&nbsp;
Frightened by unwonted solitude at bedtime, he asked to hear
&ldquo;something true,&rdquo; and was happy when Mrs. Keble
produced the Bible.&nbsp; He was a boy of beautiful countenance,
and his reverent, thoughtful look, as he repeated the Creed,
delighted Mr. Keble.&nbsp; It was little expected then that he
was doomed to a life-long struggle with invalidism, though he was
able to effect much as a thinker and a priest before he, too, was
taken to see in Paradise &ldquo;the glorious dream around him
burst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a baby sister of his who drew herself up in her
nurse&rsquo;s arms with a pretty gesture, like a pheasant&rsquo;s
neck in a sort of reproof, as she said &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; to
her little self, when she had held out a flower to Mr. Keble,
which, for once in his life, he did not notice; and his
self-reproach produced the thoughts of thankfulness.&nbsp; One of
the gems of the <i>Lyra</i>, &ldquo;Bereavement,&rdquo; was the
thought that came to the mind of the Pastor as he buried the
little sister, the only child except the elder girl, of the
bailiff at Dr. Moberly&rsquo;s farm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fire&rdquo;
embodied his feeling about a burnt child at Ampfield&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>We miss thee from thy place at school<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And on thy homeward way,<br />
Where violets, by the shady pool,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Peep out so shyly gay</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lullaby, with the view of the burnished cross upon the
spire, and the girl singing the baby to sleep with the old
Psalm&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>In Thee I put my stedfast trust,<br />
Defend me, Lord, for Thou art just,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is another Ampfield scene, inspiring noble and gentle thoughts
for Innocents&rsquo; Day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lifting up to the Cross&rdquo; (St. James&rsquo;s Day)
was the product of a drawing brought home from Germany of a sight
beheld by Miss Maria Trench, on a journey with Sir William and
Lady Heathcote.&nbsp; She afterwards became Mrs. Robert F.
Wilson, and made her first wedded home at Ampfield; and there is
another commemoration of that journey in the fountain under the
bank in Ampfield churchyard, an imitation of one observed in
Tyrol and with the motto&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While cooling waters here you
drink<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rest not your thoughts below,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Look to the sacred sign and think<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whence living waters flow,<br />
Then fearlessly advance by night or day,<br />
The holy Cross stands guardian of your way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;More Stars&rdquo; (All Saints&rsquo; Day) and
&ldquo;Wakefulness&rdquo; (The Annunciation) are reminiscences of
Charles Coleridge Pode, a little nephew of Mr. Yonge, and his
ecstatic joy on the first night of being out of doors late enough
to see the glory of the stars.&nbsp; A few months later, on a
sister being born, he hoped that her name would be Mary
&ldquo;because he liked the Virgin Mary.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when,
only a few days later, his own mother was taken from him, he lay
awake and silent, night after night.&nbsp; He, too, was one who
fulfilled his early promise, till, as a young physician, he was
cut off after much patient suffering.&nbsp; &ldquo;More
Stars&rdquo; is also attributed to an exclamation of one of Mr.
Peter Young&rsquo;s children; but in point of fact, most little
ones have broken out in a similar joyous shout on their first
conscious sight of the starry heavens.</p>
<p>Mrs. Keble used to forbear telling of the subjects of these
poems, lest, as she said, there might be a sort of blight on the
children in breaking the reserve; but most of them are beyond the
reach of that danger in publicity; and I can only further mention
that the village children <i>en masse</i>, and the curate&rsquo;s
in detail, furnished many more of the subjects, while still they
only regarded Mr. Keble as their best of playmates.</p>
<p>They cheered him when the great sorrow of his life befell him
in the secession of John Henry Newman, hitherto his friend and
fellow-worker.&nbsp; It came at a time when perhaps he was most
fitted to bear it, when his brother in Gloucestershire and his
wife at home had just begun to recover from a terrible typhoid
fever caught at Bude.</p>
<p>Words spoken in the immediate prospect of death, by Mrs.
Keble, strengthened her husband&rsquo;s faith and made him more
than ever determined to hold fast by the Church of his fathers;
and the thankfulness and exhilaration caused by the improvement
in her health carried him the better over the first blow, though
he went out alone to a quiet deserted chalk-pit to open the
letter which he knew would bring the final news of the reception
of his friend into the Roman Church.</p>
<p>Nor did his Hursley plans stand still.&nbsp; Under the
management of Sir John Taylor Coleridge and other friends, the
<i>Christian Year</i> had become much more profitable, and the
<i>Lyra</i> also brought in a considerable quota, so that the
entire work could be undertaken at Mr. Keble&rsquo;s expense.</p>
<p>It was decided, partly by Mr. Yonge himself, that the
enterprise was on too large a scale for his partial knowledge,
and moreover, much progress had been made during these nine years
in ecclesiology, so that architects who had made it their study
were to be found.&nbsp; The design was committed to William
Harrison, Esq., a relation of Archdeacon Harrison, a very old
friend and contemporary.&nbsp; It followed the lines of the
existing church, which were found to be so solid and well built
as for the most part only to need casing and not renewal, nor was
the old tower taken down.</p>
<p>The contract with Locke and Nesham was for &pound;3380,
exclusive of the flooring, the wood-work, and other fittings of
the interior.&nbsp; For this &pound;1200 was set aside, but the
sum was much exceeded, and there were many offerings from private
friends.</p>
<p>The altar of cedar-wood was the gift of Robert Williams, Esq.;
the altar plate was given by Mrs. Heathcote; the rails by the
architect; the font by the Rev. William Butler and Emma his wife,
and the clergy and sisters of Wantage.&nbsp; Mr. Butler was then
vicar of Wantage, later canon of Worcester and dean of
Lincoln.&nbsp; The present cedar credence table was made long
after Mr. Keble&rsquo;s death, the original one was walnut,
matching the chancel fittings.</p>
<p>This was proposed as the inscription on the base of the font,
to be entirely hidden&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Ecclesi&aelig;
Parochiali<br />
Sanctorum Omnium<br />
In agro Hursleiense<br />
Hunc Fontem, Lavacrum Regenerationis,<br />
In honorem D. N. J. C.<br />
Gratis animis<br />
D.D.D.<br />
Presbyteri, Diacones, Lectores, Sorores<br />
Ecclesi&aelig; SS. Petri et Pauli<br />
Indigna familia<br />
Apud Wantagium</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether the whole was actually cut out on the under side of
the granite step must be uncertain.</p>
<p>The steps of the sanctuary have in encaustic tiles these
texts.&nbsp; On the lowest:</p>
<blockquote><p>Blessed are they that do His commandments, that
they may have a right to the Tree of Life, and enter through the
gates into the city.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the step on which the rails stand:</p>
<blockquote><p>Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after
righteousness, for they shall be filled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the next:</p>
<blockquote><p>Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be
comforted.&nbsp; Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall
see God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And on the highest:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thine eyes shall see the King in His beauty, they
shall behold the land that is very far off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lectern was the offering of the friend of his youth, the
Rev. Charles Dyson, Rector of Dogmersfield, copied from that at
Corpus Christi College, where they first met.</p>
<p>The corbels were carefully chosen: those by the chancel arch
are heads of St. Peter and St. Paul, as exponents of the inner
mysteries; those by the east window are St. Athanasius and St.
Augustine as champions of the faith.&nbsp; On the corbels of the
north porch, looking towards the hills of Winchester, are Bishops
Andrewes and Ken on the outside; on the inside, Wykeham and
Waynflete.&nbsp; On the south porch, St. Augustine of Canterbury,
and the Empress Helena over the door; on the outside, Bishop
Sumner and Queen Victoria to mark the date of building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you like to have the book boards of the
seats?&rdquo; wrote the architect; &ldquo;perhaps it would
suggest the idea of a prayer desk if they were made to slope as
the chancel stalls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And certainly their finials do suggest kneeling, and the
arrangement is such that it is nearly impossible not to assume a
really devotional attitude.</p>
<p>A stranger clergyman visited the church, measured the font and
the height to the ceiling, and in due time, in 1850, there
arrived the beautiful carved canopy, the donor never being
known.</p>
<p>The windows did not receive their coloured glass at first; but
Mr. Keble had an earnest wish to make them follow the wonderful
emblematic series to which he had been accustomed in the really
unique Church of Fairford, where he had grown up.&nbsp; The glass
of these windows had been taken in a Flemish ship on the way to
Spain by one John Tame, a Gloucestershire merchant, who had
proceeded to rebuild his parish church so as fitly to receive it,
and he must also have obtained the key to their wonderful and
suggestive arrangement.</p>
<p>Fairford Church is much larger than Hursley, so that the plan
could not be exactly followed, but it was always in Mr.
Keble&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; It was proposed that the glass should
be given by the contribution of friends and lovers of the
<i>Christian Year</i>.&nbsp; Two of the windows came from the
Offertory on the Consecration day, one three-light was given by
Mrs. Heathcote (mother of Sir William), another by Sir William
and Lady Heathcote, one by the Marchioness of Bath, and one by
the Marchioness of Lothian.&nbsp; The designs were more or less
suggested by Dyce and Copley Fielding, but the execution was
carried out by Wailes, under the supervision of
Butterfield.&nbsp; The whole work was an immense delight to Mr.
Keble, and so anxious was he that the whole should be in keeping,
that the east window was actually put in three times before it
was judged satisfactory.&nbsp; The plan of the whole was Mr.
Keble&rsquo;s own; and though the colours are deeper, and what is
now called more crude, than suits the taste of the present day,
they must be looked upon with reverence as the outcome of his
meditations and his great delight.&nbsp; I transcribe the
explanation that his sister Elisabeth wrote of their
arrangement:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Hursley windows are meant to be a course of
Instruction in Sacred History from Adam to the last day the
church being dedicated to All Saints.</p>
<p>The north-west window has Adam and Noah.&nbsp; The windows
along the north aisle each represent two persons from the Old
Testament.</p>
<p>The three-light window on the north side, David with the
ground plan of the Temple, Moses with the Tables of the Law,
Solomon with the Model of the Temple.&nbsp; The Medallion under
Moses is the Altar of Incense, and some of the Holy things.</p>
<p>The whole of that window means to represent the fixing and
finishing of the Old Religion.</p>
<p>Then comes in the north chancel, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel,
and Daniel, the prophets preparing for the Gospel.</p>
<p>The north-east window has the Circumcision connecting the Law
with the Church, with the figures of Anna and Simeon on each
side.</p>
<p>East window: The Crucifixion, The Blessed Virgin and St. John
on each side, The Agony, Bearing the Cross, and the
Scourging.</p>
<p>The side window of the Sanctuary has St. Stephen and St. John
the Baptist as the nearest Martyrs to our Lord, both before and
after Him, and their martyrdoms underneath.</p>
<p>The south-east window: The Resurrection, with soldiers at the
Sepulchre.&nbsp; St. Peter and St. Paul on each side.</p>
<p>The south chancel windows: The Four Evangelists; under, St.
Luke, the Disciples at Emmaus; under, St. John, he and St. Peter
at the Sepulchre.</p>
<p>The three-light south window: St. James the Less, first Bishop
of Jerusalem; underneath, the Council in Acts x. 6.&nbsp; At his
side two successors of the Apostles, St. Clement of Rome, Phil.
iv. 3, and St. Dionysius of Athens, Acts xvii. 34, to show how
the Church is built upon the Apostles.</p>
<p>In the west window, the Last Judgment, with St. Michael with
his scales, and answering to Adam and Noah in the west window of
the north aisle; and as a repentance window, St. Peter and St.
Mary Magdalene in the west of the south aisle.&nbsp; In the two
windows close to the font, St. Philip and Nicodemus, for
baptism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So were carried out the lines in the <i>Lyra
Innocentium</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Saints are there the Living
Dead,<br />
The mourners glad and strong;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This sacred floor their quiet bed,<br />
Their beams from every window shed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their voice in every song.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The clerestory windows were put in somewhat later, on finding
that the church was dark, and Mr. Keble wished to have the
children mentioned in Scripture, in outline upon them, but this
was not carried out.</p>
<p>It was first thought probable that readers of the <i>Christian
Year</i> and the <i>Lyra Innocentium</i> might have presented
these stained windows, but the plan fell through, and the only
others actually given were the repentance window, representing
St. Peter and St. Mary Magdalene, by Mr. Harrison.&nbsp; Two were
paid for by special offertories, and the rest were finally given
by Mr. Keble, as the sums came in from his published
writings.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The spire, completing the work, was added to the ancient tower
by Sir William Heathcote.</p>
<p>The foundation stone, a brass plate with an inscription
surrounded by oak leaves and acorns, was laid on the 29th of May
1847, but the spot is unknown.&nbsp; The entire cost, exclusive
of the woodwork and the gifts mentioned, amounted to
&pound;6000.&nbsp; The large barn was used as a temporary church,
and there are happy recollections connected with it and with the
elm-shaded path between the Park and the vicarage field.&nbsp;
When all sat on forms without the shade of pews, example taught a
lesson of reverent attitude to the congregation, who felt obliged
to lay aside any bad habits which might have grown up out of
sight, so as to be unconsciously prepared for the new church,
where the very width of the open benches and the shape of their
ends are suggestive of kneeling in prayer.&nbsp; The period of
the building was a time of enjoyment to Mr. Keble, for it was
symbolical to him of the &ldquo;edifying,&rdquo; building up, of
the living stones of the True Church, and the restoring her waste
places.&nbsp; When the workmen were gone home he used to walk
about the open space in the twilight silence in prayer and
meditation.</p>
<p>When the topmost stone was to be added, on 18th October 1848,
and the weathercock finally secured, Mr. Keble ascended to the
elevation that he might set his hand to the work, and there said
a thanksgiving for the completion&mdash;&ldquo;The hands of
Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house.&nbsp; His
hands shall also finish it&rdquo; (Zech. iv. 9).</p>
<p>The day of the Consecration was an exceedingly happy one, on
24th October 1848, the only drawback being that Sir William
Heathcote was too unwell to be present.&nbsp; There was a great
gathering&mdash;the two Judges, Coleridge and Patteson, and many
other warm and affectionate friends; and Sir John Coleridge was
impressed by the &ldquo;sweet state of humble thankfulness&rdquo;
of the Vicar and his wife in the completion of the work.</p>
<p>The sermon at Evensong on that day was preached by Mr. Keble
himself, in which he spoke of the end of all things; and said the
best fate that could befall that new church was that it should be
burnt at the Judgment Day.</p>
<p>He thought, probably, of the perils of perversion from true
Catholic principles which the course of affairs in these days
made him dread exceedingly, and hold himself ready to act like
the Non-jurors, or the Free Kirk men in Scotland, who had
resigned all for the sake of principle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;I suppose it is
one&rsquo;s duty to go on as if all were encouraging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he did go on, and supported others till, by God&rsquo;s
Providence, the tide had turned, and much was effected of which
he had only dreamt as some day possible.&nbsp; It was in this
frame of mind that the poem was composed of which this is a
fragment:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shepherd lingers on the lone
hillside,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In act to count his faithful flock
again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere to a stranger&rsquo;s eye and arm untried<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He yield the rod of his old
pastoral reign.<br />
He turns and round him memories throng amain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thoughts that had seem&rsquo;d for ever left
behind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;ertake him, e&rsquo;en as by some greenwood
lane<br />
The summer flies the passing traveller find,<br />
Keen, but not half so sharp as now thrill o&rsquo;er his
mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For indeed every lapse in his parish turned to fill their
pastor with self-blame.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE GOLDEN DAYS OF HURSLEY</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> forebodings of Mr.
Keble&rsquo;s mercifully never were realised; many more years
were granted in which Hursley saw the Church and the secular
power working together in an almost ideal way.</p>
<p>To speak of what Sir William Heathcote was as a county
gentleman would be difficult.&nbsp; He was for many years
Chairman of the Quarter Sessions, and it is worth recording that
when King Frederick William IV. of Prussia wished for information
on the practical working of the English system of government, and
sent over two jurists to enquire into the working of the unpaid
magistracy, they were advised to attend the Winchester Quarter
Sessions, as one of the best regulated to be found.&nbsp; They
were guests at Hursley Park, and, as a domestic matter, their
interest in English dishes, and likewise their surprise at the
status of an English clergyman, were long remembered.</p>
<p>Considerable county undertakings originated in these
days&mdash;a new and well-managed lunatic asylum at Fareham, a
renewed jail on the then approved principles, and the
inauguration of county police.&nbsp; In all these undertakings
Sir William Heathcote and Mr. Yonge were active movers, and gave
constant superintendence while they were carried out.&nbsp; Ill
health obliged Sir William to retire from the representation of
North Hants in the Conservative interest in 1847, but in 1854, on
the recommendation of Sir Robert Harry Inglis, he was elected
member for the University of Oxford, and so remained till his
final retirement in 1868.&nbsp; What he was in both public and
private capacities has nowhere been better expressed than by the
late Earl of Carnarvon in a letter to the editor of the
<i>Times</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Long time a county member, and intimately
acquainted with the subjects and interests which formed the
heritage of English county gentlemen, he was, as a chairman of
Quarter Sessions, recognised and often appealed to as the very
representative and pattern of the class; and when afterwards he
accepted the blue riband of Parliamentary representation as
member for the University of Oxford, from first to last, through
all the waves and weathers of political and personal bitterness,
he retained the trust of friend and opponent.&nbsp; So long as he
cared to keep that seat, all men desired to keep him.&nbsp; For
this was his special characteristic, that in every period and
pursuit of life, in the public business of his county, in the
House of Commons, in the University, he not only enjoyed respect
and affection, but he conciliated the confidence of all.</p>
<p>It was the unconscious tribute to a whole life and
character.&nbsp; For to a remarkable clearness and vigour of
intellect, he added a fairness of mind, a persuasiveness and
courtesy of manner, with an inflexible uprightness of purpose,
which won to him friend and stranger alike.&nbsp; I have never
known any one who was not bettered by his converse, but I think
none outside his own county and society can fully appreciate the
remarkable influence which his name and character&mdash;in the
later years it might be truly said &ldquo;clarum et venerabile
nomen&rdquo;&mdash;exercised on all with whom he was
connected.&nbsp; If indeed he had a fault, it was that his
standard of action was so high, his nature so absolutely above
the littleness of ordinary life, that he attributed to inferior
men far purer and more unselfish objects than those that really
moved them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Vixit enim tanquam in Platonis politeia,
non tanquam in Romuli faece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is the common fault of biographers to over-colour the
character of a favourite hero, but those who knew Sir William
Heathcote will admit that there is no exaggeration in what I have
said.&nbsp; He was the highest product of a class and school of
thought which is fast disappearing, and which will perhaps find
few representatives in the next generation.&nbsp; With change of
time comes also change of men; and the statesmen and politicians
of the new world, whatever their merits or demerits, will
probably be of a very different order from him of whom I am
writing.&nbsp; The old university culture, the fastidious taste,
the independence of thought, the union of political life with
county associations&mdash;bound up as they are in this case by a
rare intelligence and a moderation of mind which trimmed, with an
almost judicial impartiality, the balance of thought on all
matters submitted to him&mdash;are not a combination to be easily
found in any age or society; but it may be safely predicted that
they will be even less common in the coming age than they were in
the generation of which Sir William Heathcote was a
representative and ornament.&nbsp; Be this, however, as it may, I
desire, by your favour, to record here the loss of one who
deserved, if ever man did, the name of an English worthy.</p>

</a></p>
<p>This warm-hearted tribute is the exact truth, as all could
testify who ever had occasion to ask Sir William&rsquo;s advice
or assistance.&nbsp; Another such testimony must be added, from a
speech of Lord Chief Justice Coleridge at Nobody&rsquo;s
Club.</p>
<blockquote><p>I looked at him from another point of view, and I
can tell you only how he struck me, a man much younger, of
different surroundings, differing from him in many opinions,
political and religious.&nbsp; Yet it is my pride and sorrowful
delight to recollect that Sir William Heathcote gave me his
friendship for nearly forty years; and it is not presumptuous to
say that his friendship deepened into affection.&nbsp; I could
not say if I would, and I would not if I could, all that he was
to me, how much of what is best (if there is any) in my life I
owe to him, how much affection and reverence has gone with him to
his grave.&nbsp; His house was open like another home; in joy,
and still more in sorrow, his sympathy was always warm and ready,
in trouble and in difficulty his advice was always at hand.&nbsp;
What advice it always was!&nbsp; What comfort and strength there
was in his company!&nbsp; For the time at least he lifted one up
and made one better.&nbsp; Inflexible integrity, stern sense of
duty, stainless honour, these qualities a very slight
acquaintance with Sir William Heathcote at once revealed.&nbsp;
But he had other great qualities too.&nbsp; He was one of the
closest and keenest reasoners I ever knew.&nbsp; He was a man of
the soundest and strongest judgment; and yet full of the most
perfect candour and full of forbearance and indulgence for other
men.&nbsp; And for a man of his intellect, and, indeed, for a
man, he was wonderfully modest and shy, and of a humility which
was, as I saw it, profoundly touching.&nbsp; Yet there was no
weakness in him.&nbsp; Not unbecomingly, not one whit more than
was just, he believed in himself, in his position, in his family;
he had dignity true and inborn without the need of
self-assertion, and love and respect towards him went hand in
hand.</p>
<p>Mr. Keble once said, coming away from a long talk with him,
that it was like holding intercourse with some old Christian
knight.&nbsp; And so it was . . .</p>
<p>I am not one of those who believe in the degeneracy of the
race, and I look forward to the future with hope rather than with
dismay.&nbsp; I believe upon the whole the world improves.&nbsp;
It is useless to be always looking back to be a <i>laudator
temporis acti se puero</i> is placed by the wise and genial
Horace to the discredit and not to the credit of old age.&nbsp;
But I do think that each age has its own virtues, and its own
type of excellence, and these do not return.&nbsp; We may have
good things, but we shall not have the same good things.&nbsp; We
shall have, I hope, good men, and great men, and noble men, in
time to come, but I do not think we shall see again a Sir William
Heathcote.&nbsp; That most charming mixture of dignified self
respect, with unfailing gracious courtesy to others, those
manners in which frankness and refinement mingled with and set
off each other, that perfect purity of thought and utterance, and
yet that thorough enjoyment of all that was good and racy in wit
or humour&mdash;this has passed away with him.&nbsp; So beautiful
and consistent a life in that kind of living we shall hardly see
again.</p>
<p>He was preserved to our time to show us of a later age a
perfect specimen of the old-fashioned, high-bred, highly
cultivated county gentleman; and a finer type of Englishman it is
hardly possible to conceive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These two portraits, they are too true to be called eulogies,
thoroughly describe Sir William as he was in friendship, as he
was not only to his original contemporaries but to their sons, so
that he came to be a generally looked up to father, as it were,
to the magistracy of the county as well as the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; A portrait of him by G. Richmond, Esq.,
R.A., was subscribed for by the magistracy and placed in the
County Hall, which began to be newly restored under his auspices,
so as worthily to show the work of Henry III. in the beautiful
old banqueting hall.</p>
<p>Already, however, a great loss had been suffered in William
Crawley Yonge, who had worked by his side in all his public
undertakings, carrying out all that was done in a spirit of
thoroughness that never rested till perfection had been attained
as far as possible.&nbsp; His own parish of Otterbourne had felt
his influence, and was noted for good order and
improvement.&nbsp; Both Otterbourne and Hursley had land in
allotments from at least 1830, long before the arrangement was
taken up by Government.&nbsp; Mr. Yonge&rsquo;s strong
churchmanship and deep religious feeling told on all around, and
there was a strong sense of his upright justice, as much as his
essential kindness.&nbsp; The end came suddenly; apoplexy brought
on by the hurry and confusion of sending off his only son, Julian
Bargus Yonge, in the Rifle Brigade to the Crimean War.&nbsp; He
died on the 26th of February 1854.&nbsp; &ldquo;What shall we do
without him?&rdquo; were the first words of Sir William
Heathcote&rsquo;s letter to Mr. Keble on receiving the
tidings.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned here that six young men from
Otterbourne were concerned in the Crimean War&mdash;Captain
Denzil Chamberlayne and Julian B. Yonge, though health obliged
the latter to return from Varna, while the former took part in
the famous Balaklava charge, and was unhurt, though his horse was
killed.&nbsp; And four of the privates, John Hawkins, James and
William Mason, and Joseph Knight, of whom only James Mason lived
to return.&nbsp; An inscription built into the wall of the
churchyard records their names, with the inscription, suggested
by Mr. Keble, &ldquo;It is good for a man that he bear the yoke
in his youth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here William Yonge&rsquo;s daughter must record Sir
William&rsquo;s never-failing kindness to her mother and herself,
both in matters of business and in personal criticism, and
assistance in those matters in her works in which the counsel of
a man acquainted with the law is needful to prevent
mistakes.&nbsp; Indeed, in the discussions on character and
adventures, nothing was ever more evident to her than that she
was talking (as Mr. Keble said) to a true specimen of the most
pure-minded chivalry.</p>
<p>On 16th September 1868 Sir William retired from Parliament,
and, on the 9th of August 1870, was sworn of the Privy
Council.&nbsp; This appointment gave him the greater satisfaction
as a testimony to his consistent integrity through his whole
parliamentary career, as it came from the Gladstonian ministry,
and he had been forced by his deep Church and State convictions
to separate from Mr. Gladstone, the friend and fellow-worker of
his younger days.</p>
<p>His last great public achievement was the rebuilding and
improvement of the County Hospital.&nbsp; Winchester had been the
first provincial city to possess a County Hospital, and the
arrangements had grown antiquated and by no means accordant with
more advanced medical practice.&nbsp; A subscription was raised,
and with the warm co-operation of Warden Robert S. Barter of
Winchester College, the present building was erected, on Mr.
Butterfield&rsquo;s plans, in a more healthy and airy situation,
in the year 1868, with a beautiful chapel for the nurses and
patients, and with the modern system of nursing carried
out.&nbsp; As was said, when in 1878 Sir William resigned the
post of Chairman of the Committee, he was the father and the
founder of the institution.</p>
<p>Few men have earned by a lifetime so much honour, gratitude,
and affection as he by one consistent, upright course of life, or
have left a nobler memory.</p>
<p>A few words we must give to the festivals.&nbsp; There was the
yearly distribution of Christmas beef to all the labourers and
artisans employed on the estate, and widows.&nbsp; There was
occasionally a grand &ldquo;beating of the bounds&rdquo; of the
Manor of Merdon, followed by a dinner in a tent to the tenants,
at which the &ldquo;Lord of the Manor&rdquo; made a speech,
hoping that in times to come the days of &ldquo;the Old Sir
William&rdquo; might be kindly remembered; and somewhat later
there were private theatricals, performed chiefly by the family,
which were a great pleasure to friends and tenants.</p>
<p>What a centre of hospitality, cheerfulness, and kindness
Hursley Park was in those days can hardly be described, though
remembered by many as a sort of golden age of Hursley.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">HURSLEY VICARAGE</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Golden Age of Hursley did not
deduce all its honour from the manor house.&nbsp; The vicarage
was perhaps the true centre of the light which the Park
reflected, or rather both knew that their radiance alike came
from One Source above, in whose Light they sought to walk.</p>
<p>The happy, sometimes playful, intercourse between them may
perhaps best be exemplified by the petition sent up by Mr. Keble
on an alarm that the copse on Ladwell hill was about to be cut
down in obedience to the dicta of agricultural judges who much
objected to trees and broad hedgerows.</p>
<p>Ladwell, or as it probably ought to be, Ladywell hill, is a
steep bank, thickly clothed with trees and copsewood, with
cottages nestling under it, on the southward road from Hursley,
and on the top the pathway to Field House, the farm rented by Dr.
Moberly, Headmaster of Winchester College (since Bishop of
Salisbury) as the holiday resort of his family.&nbsp; It is a
delightful place, well worthy of the plea for its
preservation.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The young flow&rsquo;ret newly blown&rdquo; was Sir
William&rsquo;s son Godfrey, who faded at seven years old.&nbsp;
When his mind was wandering, one of his dreamy utterances was,
&ldquo;I should like to fly softly.&rdquo;&nbsp; And therefore
Mr. Keble suggested that the words on his little grave (outside
the mausoleum) should be &ldquo;Who are these that fly as a
cloud?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The intercourse of the vicarage with the Park, as with all
this neighbourhood, was affectionate, intimate, or neighbourly
and friendly, according as there was likeness of mind.&nbsp; The
impression left was always a cheerful one of hospitality and of a
kind of being on holy ground.&nbsp; The house stands on the side
of a rapid slope from the Park, with a terrace raised on brick
arches overlooking the lawn, only separated by a low wall from
the Churchyard.&nbsp; Here, in early summer, the school children
from both the outlying congregations met those of Hursley at tea,
and for games in the Park, ending with standing round in the
twilight below the terrace, and singing the National Anthem and
Bishop Ken&rsquo;s Evening Hymn.&nbsp; The Anniversary of the
Consecration Day, falling late in the autumn, was the occasion of
a feast for the elders of the parish above sixty years old.&nbsp;
This followed, of course, on festal services, when those who
heard it can hardly forget a sermon of Warden Barter&rsquo;s on
the 134th Psalm, when, with the noble sweetness of his
countenance lighted up, he spoke of our delight in nature being
the joy of a child in the beauty of his father&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>A new organ had been given, and the choir had been brought to
great improvement during the few years that the Rev. W. Le Geyt
was at Hursley.&nbsp; Also a mission school chapel had been built
at Pitt, a hamlet on the downs towards Winchester, and a second
curate had been added to the staff.&nbsp; The present writer can
only dwell with thankfulness too deep to be spoken on Mr.
Keble&rsquo;s influence, not so much friendly as fatherly, and he
was the best and kindest of critics in literary affairs.</p>
<p>But throughout, the vicar was the personal minister to each
individual of his flock&mdash;teaching in the school, catechising
in the church, most carefully preparing for Confirmation,
watching over the homes, and, however otherwise busied, always at
the beck and call of every one in the parish.&nbsp; To the old
men and women of the workhouse he paid special attention,
bringing them little dainties, trying to brighten their dull
minds as a means of reaching their souls, and endeavouring to
raise their spirits to higher things.&nbsp; One who had been
removed to another Union, when asked how he liked Hursley, said,
&ldquo;It seemed as if they was saying Holy, Holy, Holy, all day
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During this time Mr. Keble wrote his <i>Life of Bishop
Wilson</i>, making two visits to the Isle of Man to study the
situation and the documents there preserved; various of the
&ldquo;Plain Sermons&rdquo;; some controversial pamphlets
defending the cause of the Church; and above all, the treatise on
&ldquo;Eucharistic Adoration.&rdquo;&nbsp; He assisted Dr. J. M.
Neale in drawing up the <i>Salisbury Hymnal</i>, a precursor of
<i>Hymns Ancient and Modern</i>, and contributed several hymns,
especially those for Rogation days, for the service for Holy
Matrimony, and a very grand one for the Feast of St. John the
Evangelist, which has not found place in <i>Hymns Ancient and
Modern</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>All this time he was the prime counsellor and assistant to
many engaged in church work or church defence, among whom may be
mentioned Dr. Pusey, Bishop Alexander Forbes of Brechin, Bishop
Walter Hamilton of Salisbury, the Rev. W. J. Butler of Wantage
(Dean of Lincoln), and Canon Liddon.&nbsp; To them Hursley
Vicarage was a place of holy counsel and peaceful rest.</p>
<p>Bishop Robert Gray of Capetown, and the great Bishop George
Augustus Selwyn, were warmly welcomed there on their visits to
England; and the young son of the last-mentioned, John Richardson
Selwyn, when left in England for education, often happily spent
part of his holidays there.&nbsp; No doubt this had a share in
his preparation for his future work in Melanesia, closed early by
the failure of health that brought him, after a few more years,
to his grave.</p>
<p>Another guest was Queen Emma of the Sandwich Isles, literally
the Queen of the South, come to hear the wisdom of the Saint; and
last of all, the friend and partner of his earlier work, the
sharer in the revival of the Church from her torpid repose, John
Henry Newman, who met Dr. Pusey there for one last day,
fulfilling the words written long before&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Yet deem not on such parting sad<br />
Shall dawn no welcome dear and glad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But neither of these two last visits took place till after the
changes of old age had begun at Hursley.</p>
<p>The first great sorrow came in the death of Elisabeth, the
wise, gentle, and quiet invalid sister who had been always part
of Mr. Keble&rsquo;s life, and seemed, above all, to diffuse
about her an atmosphere of peace and holiness.&nbsp; After a
gradual, almost imperceptible decay, she sank to sleep on the 7th
of August 1860.&nbsp; Mrs. Keble&rsquo;s always frail health
began to fail more and more, so that winters in a warmer climate
became necessary.&nbsp; Dawlish, Penzance, and Torquay were
resorted to in successive winters, and Mr. Keble began to revolve
the question whether it might not become his duty to resign the
living, where, to his own humble apprehension, all his best
efforts had failed to raise the people to his own standard of
religion.&nbsp; However, this was averted, and he was still at
his post when, on the night of St. Andrew&rsquo;s Day, the 30th
of November 1864, as he was sitting up writing to Dean Stanley on
a passage of which he disapproved in the <i>History of the Jewish
Church</i>, the hand of warning touched him with a slight stroke
of paralysis.&nbsp; With complete rest at Torquay and Penzance
during the winter, he recovered to a considerable degree, and
came home to resume many of his usual habits, but Mrs.
Keble&rsquo;s suffering from spasmodic asthma had become very
frequent, and it became necessary, early in the autumn, to remove
to Bournemouth.</p>
<p>There they remained, she gradually sinking, and only
distressed at the thought of his being left; he bearing up in
silent resignation and prayer till, on the 22nd of March, a
mistake in using a cold instead of a hot bath brought on a shock,
and in four days more, on Maundy-Thursday the 29th of March 1866,
the voice of Hursley and Otterbourne was, &ldquo;Thy master is
taken from thy head to-day.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was granted to her to
be at rest concerning him before she followed, six weeks later,
on the 11th of May, to the double grave.</p>
<p>It was on a beautiful day, with the celandines shining like
stars on the bank, that we laid him in his grave, a concourse of
sorrowing friends being present, who could look to him as having
wakened and cherished their best aspirations; and those who had
come under his personal influence feeling that a loved father had
been taken away.&nbsp; It was on that day that Alexander Forbes,
Bishop of Brechin, Dr. Pusey, Dean Hook, Sir William Heathcote,
Dean Butler, and others, decided that the most fitting memorial
would be the building of the College at Oxford which bears his
name, and is pledged to Church principles, and to a scale of
expenses not beyond the reach of less wealthy students.&nbsp; A
monument was in due time raised above the graves, designed by Mr.
Butterfield&mdash;Mr. Keble&rsquo;s in red granite, Mrs.
Keble&rsquo;s in Derbyshire marble.</p>

<p>The place in the chancel where the coffin of John Keble,
priest of the parish, had been placed before the morning&rsquo;s
Celebration, was marked by a brass cross given by the
parishioners, who more and more felt that they had had among them
a saint of God, and can hardly fail to think of him when they
sing, &ldquo;O ye holy and humble men of heart, bless ye the
Lord, praise Him and magnify Him for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">LATER CHANGES</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the October of 1853, the Rev.
Robert F. Wilson having resigned the curacy of Ampfield, he was
replaced by the Rev. John Frewen Moor, who on 12th January of the
next year became perpetual curate and by and by vicar.</p>
<p>Improvements in the church advanced in his time.&nbsp; The
stained glass of the east and west windows of the church were
given by Sir William and Lady Heathcote, the south-east window is
a memorial of Mr. Keble, the other south windows of Mr.
Moor&rsquo;s three sons, one of whom was drowned while preparing
for mission work in Newfoundland, and another died on his return
from what was truly a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.</p>
<p>On Mr. Keble&rsquo;s death, the Rev. James Gavin Young,
brother to the much beloved curate, the Rev. Peter Young, was
presented to the living of Hursley.</p>
<p>In 1871 the Rev. William Bigg Wither, after thirty-five
years&rsquo; diligent work in the parish, decided on accepting
the rectory of Hardwicke in Buckinghamshire.&nbsp; Great
improvements had taken place in his time, and he was greatly
beloved by his flock, from whom, for nearly forty years, he had
never been absent for a single Sunday, and during all that time
had given them the privilege of daily matins and evensong.</p>
<p>As he never liked the acceptance of testimonials, it was
resolved that, in memory of his long services, a new girls&rsquo;
school should be built, the old one having become quite
insufficient, and with it a master&rsquo;s house with a tower to
contain a village clock, which was given out of the savings of
Mrs. Smith and her sister and brother Miss and Mr. Pink, a kind
old thatcher, who will long be remembered.</p>
<p>In that year, 1869, Bishop Sumner resigned the see of
Winchester, and for three years the diocese had the benefit of
the great powers and eloquence of Bishop Samuel Wilberforce,
whose Confirmation addresses at each of the churches will be
remembered for life by his candidates.</p>
<p>The Rev. Walter Francis Elgie became Mr. Young&rsquo;s curate
at Otterbourne, and in 1875 the first vicar thereof, Sir William
Heathcote having arranged the means of undoing Bishop
Pontissara&rsquo;s injustice.&nbsp; This was rendered practicable
by the liberality of Mrs. William Gibbs, who purchased the
advowson of Otterbourne for a sum that Sir William applied to the
endowment of Hursley, so as to compensate for the loss of the
tithes of Otterbourne.</p>
<p>By this time a considerable industry had grown up at Allbrook
with a saw mill and brick making, and the inhabitants, with a
little assistance, erected a mission chapel and school.&nbsp;
There the kind and excellent Rowland Jones Bateman, Esquire, of
the Grange, gave hearty assistance as a teacher, and latterly as
a licensed reader, being thus appointed by Bishop Edward Harold
Browne, who succeeded to the See of Winchester on the sudden
death of Bishop Wilberforce.</p>
<p>He came to reconsecrate Otterbourne Church, when an apse had
been added to the choir, and several other alterations made, with
the view of rendering it more suitable for devout worship than
knowledge or means had made practicable when the church was
built; and other alterations have since been made in the same
direction.</p>
<p>The kindly and open-hearted Squire of Cranbury, Thomas
Chamberlayne, Esq., died on October 1876, being succeeded by his
son Tankerville Chamberlayne, Esq.; and Brambridge, after
descending from the Smythes to a niece, the Honourable Mrs.
Craven, whose son sold it, has since several times changed
owners.</p>
<p>On the 25th February 1881, Otterbourne lost the first vicar,
Mr. Elgie, and the Rev. Henry Walter Brock was presented to the
vicarage, when many improvements were further carried on.</p>
<p>But change and decay mark every generation in turn, and there
is little else to record.&nbsp; The joyous genial days at Hursley
Park had passed away, and the days of agricultural depression had
set in, causing much trouble and anxiety, with alterations met
with simple bravery and cheerfulness, according with the
character that could bear adversity as nobly as prosperity.</p>
<p>The Rev. Thomas Mozley, in the somewhat discursive
reminiscences of his latter years, declares that long before, he
had seen one of Mr. Keble&rsquo;s curates in tears at the
possibility of the repeal of the Corn-Laws causing Sir William
Heathcote to put down one of his equipages.&nbsp; None of the
curates could recollect the occasion, and certainly they lived to
see what might have been more deplored, for at the end of Sir
William&rsquo;s life there were actually only two little ponies
in his stables.</p>
<p>Though never a very strong man, he preserved all his powers
and his kind interest and thorough attention to whatever was
brought before him until the end came, as to &ldquo;a shock of
corn in full season,&rdquo; and he was taken to his rest on the
17th of August 1881, leaving to all who knew him the precious
recollection of emphatically &ldquo;a just man&rdquo; serving God
in his generation.</p>
<p>That simple walking funeral, devoid of all pomp or show, but
attended by at least 130 friends, did indeed show the esteem in
which he was held as the moving spring of all the best
undertakings for many years in the county; and may Hursley never
forget that she is, as it were, consecrated by having been the
home of two such men as John Keble and William Heathcote.</p>
<p>Still there are changes to record: Julian Bargus Yonge, after
long inactivity from broken health, sold the property at
Otterbourne to Major Robert Scarlett, and removed to London,
where he died a few days later, in October 1891.</p>
<p>In 1892 Mr. Brock was invited to return to his house in
Guernsey to become rector of the parish of St. Pierre au Bois in
succession to his father and grandfather, and the Rev. Henry
Albany Bowles became vicar of Otterbourne.</p>
<p>Other changes had in the meantime taken place.&nbsp; The
Hursley estate, including not only the Manor of Merdon but recent
purchases, had become much encumbered from the inevitable
consequences of agricultural depression, and after the provision
for the family had been made, of whom there were ten survivors
besides Lady Heathcote, it proved that the only way of clearing
off the various liabilities was to sell.</p>
<p>Lady Heathcote gave up her right to a life residence at
Hursley Park, and after 170 years of possession, during which the
family had well merited general affection and esteem, they
resigned themselves to the sale of the greater part of the
property.&nbsp; The Park, the advowson of the living, and the
greater part of the parish, were bought by Joseph Baxendale,
Esq., in 1888.</p>
<p>The more distant portions were more gradually disposed of, and
recently the ground of Cranbury Common and Hiltingbury has risen
in value from brick-making industries, and the convenience of
Chandler&rsquo;s (or Chaloner&rsquo;s) Ford Station, and a large
and rising colony, on the confines of five parishes, Otterbourne,
North Stoneham, Ampfield, Hursley, and Baddesley.&nbsp; A school
chapel was raised, but soon proved insufficient, and there is now
a church.&nbsp; The place has been formed into a separate parish,
Otterbourne resigning the hamlet of Fryern Hill; Ampfield, part
of Fryern Hill and numerous houses built among the plantations of
Cuckoo Bushes and Cranbury Common; and Stoneham, many houses
placed among the trees of the former Fleming property.</p>
<p>And another change took place, Mr. Frewen Moor, from
increasing age and loss of eyesight, resigned the pastoral charge
he had so carefully and affectionately fulfilled for forty-four
years, and was succeeded by the Rev. Vere Awdry.</p>

153</span>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A SURVEY</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> may be best to conclude with a
sketch of the present appearance of the parishes (in 1898).</p>
<p>To begin at the west, where the border is on Romsey,
Michelmersh and Farley, the Romsey road, formerly the direct road
from Winchester to Salisbury, running through it, beside Ampfield
Church and village.&nbsp; This is high ground, and Ampfield Wood
extends along it to the borders of Hursley Park.&nbsp; It is
chiefly of oak, fir, and beech, and on the southern side are the
fine arcades of beechwood that Mr. Keble used to call Hursley
Cathedral.&nbsp; From one point in the wood long sight can
distinguish a sort of needle which is the spire of Salisbury
Cathedral.&nbsp; The wood is very old, probably primeval, as it
is guarded in the oldest notices of the Manor of Merdon, and it
contains a flora of its own, in which may be mentioned that rare
and beautiful <i>Melittis Melissophyllum</i>, bastard balm, like
a purple and white archangel.&nbsp; The bilberry is plentiful
there and all along the beautiful park-like road to Romsey and
Salisbury.&nbsp; The church, raised above the wayside fountain,
and the churchyard full of very beautiful varieties of pine,
still nestles into the wood, and there is a charming view over
the open country towards the south.</p>
<p>Farley Chamberlayne, which joins the wood on the other side,
rising much higher, has a monument viewed from all the country
round, erected by one of the St. John family to a horse which
leapt down with him into a chalk-pit of considerable depth, and
so alighted that neither horse nor man was hurt, and the horse
won the cup at the races the year after, under the name of Beware
Chalk-Pit.&nbsp; Parnholt wood, that clothes one side of the
mount, is beloved by botanists for possessing tracts of lily of
the valley, <i>Convallaria majalis</i>, and likewise <i>Paris
quadrifolia</i>, a great rarity.&nbsp; The mount itself is bare
chalk down, <a name="citation154"></a><a href="#footnote154"
class="citation">[154]</a> but has a wonderful view over the
whole undulating country&mdash;to the southward the beginning of
forest land, and to the south-east, where the beechwoods of South
Lynch begin to creep up the rapid slope of chalk, there is
delightful hunting ground; for bee orchis (<i>Ophrys apifera</i>)
swarm; careful search may discover the brown velvet blue-eyed
fly, <i>Ophrys muscifera</i>, the quaint <i>man</i> and
<i>dwarf</i> orchis can be found; butterfly or honey-suckle
orchis, <i>Habenaria</i>, as we are constrained to term it, is
frequent; and where the beech-trees begin there are those curious
parasites which are the only plants they tolerate, the <i>Listera
Nidus-avis</i>, birds&rsquo;-nest orchis, the <i>Monotropa
Hypopitys</i>, or yellow birds&rsquo;-nest, the beautiful
lily-like <i>Epipactis Grandiflora</i>; while helleborine and the
curious and capricious tooth-wort, <i>Spir&aelig;a
Filipendula</i> or drop-wort, <i>Gentiana Amarella</i>, and other
distinctive chalk-down plants are found.</p>
<p>On the southern side of Ampfield lies the parish of North
Baddesley, which preserves the curious old Hampshire village
church with a timber bell turret.&nbsp; This side is where there
once stood a Gospel oak, marking the place where the Gospel was
read, when the bounds of the Manor of Merdon were trod at
Rogation-tide.&nbsp; The whole tract is an extension of the New
Forest land, almost all heather and bog, undulating and, in the
drier spots, growing bushes of the glistening holly.&nbsp; It is
forest scenery without the trees, excepting the plantations of
fir made by a former generation, but presenting grand golden
fields of gorse in the spring, and of red and purple heather in
early autumn; and whereas the northern side of Hursley gives the
distinctive flora of dry chalk, here we have the growth of the
black peaty bog, the great broom-rape, brown and leafless,
growing on the roots of the gorse; the curious dodder spreading a
tangled red skein of thread over it gemmed with little round
white balls, the rare marsh cinquefoil, the brilliant yellow
asphodel, the delicate, exquisite, bog pimpernel, the blue
skull-cap, the two weird and curious sun-dews, and even in former
times the beautiful dark blue <i>Gentiana Pneumonanthe</i>, as
well as the two pinguiculas&mdash;<i>Vulgaris</i>, like a violet,
and the rarer <i>Lusitanica</i>.</p>
<p>But alas! the giant called &ldquo;High Farming&rdquo; is an
enemy to the botanists, and had starved out many of the choicest
of these, even before the building of villas at Chandler&rsquo;s
Ford put a total end to most of them.</p>
<p>Hursley Park touches on one side the forest land of Ampfield
Wood, and on the other the chalk of the South Downs, and it shows
its length of having been reclaimed in the well-kept trees with
their straight lines finishing their foliage beneath, due to the
feeding of deer and cattle.&nbsp; Its chief beauty is when the
thorns are like masses of snow.&nbsp; Moreover, there grows up
from the moat at Merdon, over the back of the remains of the
gateway, a traveller&rsquo;s joy with an enormous trunk that must
be of many years&rsquo; duration.&nbsp; Merdon Castle is just
where the chalk begins, and from thence, running down to the
house itself, there is a broad level space of deer park clear of
trees, and making a fit setting to the early Georgian red brick
house with the gardens on the other side, containing several fine
old lime-trees.&nbsp; On all the sides, except towards Ampfield,
the ground falls away, and the village of well-kept, picturesque
cottages lies in the valley beneath the park, the tall white
spire of the church making a beautiful object looking along the
walnut avenue leading from the gardens.</p>
<p>The lime-trees enclose the church on three sides most fitly,
except in the eyes of an old woman, some sixty years ago, who
objected to worshipping in a grove.</p>
<p>At a short distance eastward of the churchyard begin the two
roads, both leading to Otterbourne; the northern one, part of
which still bears the name of King&rsquo;s Lane, is said to have
been the way taken by Purkis&rsquo;s cart when bringing William
Rufus&rsquo;s body to Winchester.</p>
<p>The southern road, which is part of the Romsey and Southampton
highway, soon rises into the height of Ladwell Hill, fields with
very fine elms bordering it on the west, and the copse of Mr.
Keble&rsquo;s petition on the east.&nbsp; At the gate of the wood
is a patch of the rare <i>Geranium Ph&aelig;un</i>, the dusky
crane&rsquo;s-bill, but whether wild, or a stray from a disused
garden, is doubtful.</p>
<p>After another dip, the road to Otterbourne leaves the main
one, and skirts Cranbury Park, and has on the opposite side the
once open country, since planted first with trees and later with
houses, leading to Chandler&rsquo;s Ford.&nbsp; The very pretty
and uncommon <i>Linaria repens</i>, a toad flax, white and
striped with purple, is a speciality that it is hoped may not be
smothered with houses and gardens.&nbsp; A lane, called even in
1588 Mallibar, runs southward over the heath, and emerges into
the Southampton road.&nbsp; It is a grand place for heath, ferns,
and broom-rape, with daffodils in a field at the end.&nbsp; There
are remains of a farm-yard and orchard, once apparently rented by
Mr. Coram of Cranbury.</p>
<p>Cranbury Park is on a hill, intersected by various springs,
and where the peaty ground soon gives way to gravel.&nbsp; The
house, a large red brick one, built round a court, so that it
looks low in proportion to its width, is on the level ground at
the top, flat as it fronts to the south, but in the rear
descending rapidly.&nbsp; In fact, on that side the grounds have
the air of cresting the hill, and there is a group of exceedingly
tall pine-trees which are a land-mark of the country on all
sides, though the tallest of them was blown down a few years
ago.&nbsp; Near them is one of the old-fashioned orangeries, with
a great deal of wall and very little glass, and near it stands
the sundial of Newtonian fame.</p>
<p>From the ridge where the pines stand the ground descends
through very steep fields belonging to the Home Farm at Longmore
to King&rsquo;s Lane, where Hursley parish touches upon Compton,
at the hamlet of Silkstede, which is reported to have been a
priory, and has a fine old barn and a dell in the orchard full of
snowdrops.&nbsp; No mention of it is in Dugdale&rsquo;s
<i>Monasticon</i>, and it was probably only a grange; but it
still owns some very fine old trees, the bordering copses are
full of violets, and the rare <i>Lathyrus Nissolia</i> has been
found there.</p>
<p>Returning to the open park in front of Cranbury, there occurs
that fitfully blooming plant,
lady&rsquo;s-tresses&mdash;<i>Neottia Spiralis
autumnalis</i>&mdash;and a profusion of brown-winged orchis and
cowslips.&nbsp; All the slopes are covered with copsewood, much
of it oak, the tints of which are lovely shades of green in
spring and golden-brown in early autumn.&nbsp; The whole is a
place remarkable for masses of blossom.&nbsp; There are giant
garlands of white wild cherry above in spring, and equally white
anemone below; by and by an acre of primroses growing close
together, not large, but wonderfully thick, a golden river of
king-cup between banks of dog&rsquo;s mercury, later on whole
glades of wild hyacinth, producing a curious effect of blue
beneath the budding yellow green of the young birches with silver
stems.&nbsp; Sheets of the scarlet sorrel by and by appear, and
foxgloves of all sizes troop in the woods, and are succeeded by
the rose bay willow herb, and lastly come perfect clouds of the
little devils&rsquo;-bit scabious.&nbsp; Ferns adorn the watery
glens, and bracken spreads on the undulating ground in wild
beauty of form, here and there enhanced by a bright faded tint of
gold.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the hill, close to Otterbourne Church, the
gravel has given place to clay.&nbsp; On the side of the hill, a
rough hedge divides the private ground of the copse from
Otterbourne Common and Hill, which is crossed by the old high
road from London to Southampton, the very steep hill having had a
cutting made through it.&nbsp; The Cranbury side of the road has
the village cricket ground on it, though burrowed under by the
concentric brick-work circles of the Southampton Company&rsquo;s
water works, which are entered by a little staircase tower,
cemented over so as to be rather ornamental than otherwise.&nbsp;
Beside it, there is a beautiful view of a delightful home
landscape; stretching out on the south lie woods and low hills to
the gleam of Southampton Water, the smoke of the steamers, and
even the gray hills of the Isle of Wight.&nbsp; On the other
side, beyond the rich water meadows of the Itchen valley, may be
seen the woods of Colden Common rising into Concord Hill, and
beyond them the view is closed by the broken outline of Longwood
Warren.&nbsp; While more to the north there is visible the round
smooth outline of &ldquo;the beech-crowned steep&rdquo; of St.
Catherine&rsquo;s Hill.&nbsp; It is a charming prospect,
especially on a day of sunshine and clouds, making shadows chase
one another over the distance.&nbsp; Nor, except for a white
thatched cottage and an extensive gravel-pit by the road, have
the native charms of the hill been much disturbed; and gorse,
heather, and honeysuckle flourish till, where the clay begins,
there is a grassy slope bearing a few elms and
horse-chestnuts.&nbsp; Perhaps loaded waggons drop some of their
seeds, for on those cuttings through the gravel on the road-side
have sprung up the dainty little yellow stonecrop, <i>Sedum
acre</i>, and the Stork&rsquo;s bill, <i>Erodium
moschatum</i>.&nbsp; These are plentifully spread over the
cutting; but the <i>Trifolium arvense</i>, which came for a few
years, seems to have vanished again.</p>
<p>On the eastern side of the road lies the village green.&nbsp;
The old cottages used to stand round in an irregular
amphitheatre, some with poplars before them, and the name of
Maypole-field (now allotments) testifies to there having been
sports there before the memory of the present man.&nbsp; The
arrangements have been broken by modern building, but
&ldquo;right of common&rdquo; still protects the green expanse
for donkeys and children, including the more youthful cricketers,
not yet promoted to matches.</p>
<p>From the top of the hill extends a large space of woodland
known as Otterbourne Park.&nbsp; The higher part is full of a
growth of beautiful ling, in delicate purple spikes, almost as
tall as the hazel and mountain ash are allowed to grow.&nbsp; On
summer evenings it is a place in which to hear the nightingale,
and later to see the glow-worm, and listen to the purring of the
nightjar.&nbsp; It is a very ancient wood, part of the original
grant of St. Magdalen College, and bears plenty of the yellow
cow-wheat which Kingsley holds as the mark of primeval
waste-land; but it is not exceptional in its other plants, except
that a spring, half-way down, has the rare <i>Viola palustris</i>
around it.&nbsp; The whole tract remained untouched till a
pleasant residence called the Grange was taken out of it to the
south, at a ground rent, by Rowland Jones Bateman, Esq., whose
beneficent kindness and excellent religious influence told on all
the neighbourhood, and especially on the hamlet of Allbrook, till
his death in 1897.</p>
<p>The parish here borders on Bishopstoke, and the Grange
commands a pleasant view over the water meadows, and up the
opposite Bishopstoke Hill.&nbsp; Otterbourne Park reaches down to
where the meadows begin along the course of the Itchen.</p>
<p>In these meadows, the will-of-the-wisp has undoubtedly been
seen, as well as in a wet field in the central part of the
parish; but it is a disappointing phenomenon&mdash;nothing but a
misty, pale bluish light, rather like the reality of a
comet&rsquo;s tail, and if &ldquo;he&rdquo; was by
&ldquo;Friar&rsquo;s Lantern led,&rdquo; &ldquo;he&rdquo; must
have had a strong imagination.</p>
<p>Probably drainage, sawmills, and brick-making have exorcised
Jack-o&rsquo;-Lantern, for Allbrook, from a hamlet of four
cottages, has grown up into a considerable village, with a
school-chapel of its own, and a large population.&nbsp; The two
farms called Hams and Boyatt border it on the southern or
Bishopstoke side, and on the northern it extends to Highbridge
(apparently so called from the lowness of the bridge), where is
another small hamlet, half Otterbourne half Twyford; and there
was for many years a Roman Catholic chapel attached to a large
cottage, and distinguished by a cross.&nbsp; It was endowed, but
nearly all the flock having faded away, the endowment was
transferred to Eastleigh, and it is now inhabited by a market
gardener with numerous glass houses.</p>
<p>It is the real Itchen that is crossed at Highbridge.&nbsp; The
canal goes through Allbrook, but both serve the purpose of
irrigation, and a network of ditches crosses the meadows.&nbsp;
Both river and canal, too, are excellent for fishermen, who in
the season can find</p>
<blockquote><p>here and there a lusty trout,<br />
And here and there a grayling</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in the clear stream, which now and then an otter inhabits,
soon to serve as sport for his many enemies.</p>
<p>Smooth and level, the river is still an unfailing source of
enjoyment in the walks along the towing path, when moor-hens are
swimming, and dipping on a glimpse of the spectator; when fish
are rising, or sometimes taking a sudden &ldquo;header&rdquo;
into the air and going down with a splash; when the water-vole
rushes for his hole with head just above the water; when a blue
flash of kingfisher darts by, and the deep blue or green
dragon-flies sit on the sedges, or perhaps a tiny May-fly sits on
a rail to shake off its last garment, and come forth a snow-white
fairy thing with three long whisks at the tail.</p>
<p>The <i>real</i> Itchen is the boundary, and beyond lies
Brambridge.&nbsp; But on coming to the bridge over the canal, the
road leads westward, towards Otterbourne Hill.&nbsp; First it
skirts a stream, a tributary to the Itchen, and goes between
meadows till the old church is reached, now only a chancel in the
midst of old headstones, and still bordered with trees on the
bank between it and the stream.&nbsp; There are square brick
monuments covered with stone slabs.&nbsp; In the interstices
there used to be a great deal of <i>Adiantum
nigrum</i>&mdash;black maidenhair, but it has disappeared.</p>
<p>The flowers are quite different from those of the peaty
marshes on the opposite side of the district, belonging to an
alluvial soil, washed down from the chalk hills.&nbsp; The great
reed-mace adorns the Itchen, and going along the disused towing
path of the canal there is to be found abundance of the black and
golden spikes of the sedge, and the curious balls of the
bur-reed, very like the horrid German weapon called a morning
star.&nbsp; Also meadow-sweet, meadow-rue, and comfrey of every
shade of purple, the water avens and forget-me-not, also that
loveliest plant the bog-bean, with trefoil leaves and feathery
blossoms.&nbsp; <i>Orchis latifolia</i> is in plenty, and also
<i>Orchis incarnata</i>, sometimes called the Romsey
orchis.&nbsp; Of late years the <i>mimulus</i> has gilded the
bank of one of the ditches.&nbsp; Is it compensation for the
<i>Pinguicula vulgaris</i>, which has been drained away, or the
mountain pink at Highbridge, which I suspect some gardener of
appropriating?&nbsp; Higher up the course of the river, <i>Orchis
conopsea</i>, long-spurred and very sweet, the compact <i>Orchis
pyramidalis</i>, and the rare <i>Epipactis palustris</i> are to
be found, as well as <i>Campanula Glomerata</i>, and crow garlic,
in an old chalk-pit nearly destroyed by the railway and the water
works.</p>
<p>Otterbourne Farm bounds the churchyard on the west side, and
below, on either side of a low bridge, stand two fine yew trees
where boys in the old church days used to climb and devour the
waxen berries with impunity.&nbsp; Meadows lie on each side the
road, and on the left is a short lane, leading up to the old
manor house, the Moat-house but it is no longer even a
farm-house&mdash;the moat is choked with mud and reeds, and only
grows fine forget-me-nots, and the curious panel picture of a
battle, apparently between Turks and Austrians, has been
removed.&nbsp; The fields beyond, bordering on Otterbourne Park,
are the best for cowslips in the parish.</p>
<p>Returning into the road, whose proper name is Kiln Lane, the
way leads between two fields, oddly enough called Courtiers,
rising a little, and with a view of Otterbourne Hill, the east
side of which, below the slope of Otterbourne Park, has been laid
out in allotments for more than fifty years, at first by Mr.
Yonge, though it has now been taken in hand by the Parish
Council, and it makes a pleasant picture of stripes of various
shades of green and brown with people working in them.&nbsp; The
hedge sweeps round in a curve, leaving a space where stands the
Pound, still sometimes used for straying cattle.&nbsp; The Stocks
were once there, but never used in the memory of man.</p>
<p>The valley is of clay, strong yellow clay favourable to oaks,
though too many have been cut down, whenever they came to a good
size in the hedges; but in the grounds of Otterbourne House,
where they have been undisturbed for at least eighty years, there
are a number of very handsome well-grown trees; and near them is
Dell Copse, dug out for the bricks for the &ldquo;King&rsquo;s
House,&rdquo; and the home of countless daffodils.&nbsp; Half way
up the hill is a small spring, where the water rises so as to
make little jets of sand.&nbsp; It flows down in a gutter to the
green at the opening of Kiln Lane, around the Pound, and here
spreads into a pool, called the Dip Hole, the resort of cows from
the common, and long of village women, as the blue galt below the
yellow clay never affords good water, but this has been remedied
by water works.</p>
<p>At this spot Kiln Lane opens into the high-road, and there is
a broad space of green at nearly the bottom of the hill, before
the main body of the village begins.&nbsp; Every line in the
place is a curve-hedges, roads, gardens and all, and this gives
the view a peculiar grace, so that one of the old men used to say
he knew not where to find a better or prettier view than looking
down into the village from the hill, and on far beyond to
Owslebury, Crowd Hill, and Longwood Warren, a lovely home
view.</p>
<p>The church stands on the hillside just where the upward road
to Cranbury begins to branch off.&nbsp; The churchyard is full of
crosses, a large granite cross in memory of John Keble as rector
in the midst, and there is a splendid Wellingtonia, or more
properly a Sequoia, now about fifty years old, and overtopping
the bell-turret.&nbsp; And the outside space on this side is
scattered with horse chestnuts and elms.</p>
<p>Below are the schools, and the irregular curving street of
houses, thatched, tiled, or slated, in gardens or close to the
road.&nbsp; Here stands Otterbourne House, and, after two large
fields, more cottages, and the vicarage, like the schools, with
the fancy brick chimneys moulded at Hursley.</p>
<p>Not far beyond, the little stream that had crossed the meadows
from the church is spanned by another bridge, belonging to the
high-road from Winchester.&nbsp; Thence may be seen the source of
the stream, in Pool Hole, said to be fed from Merdon well, and
now forced to spread into a bed of watercresses.</p>
<p>And here begins Compton, Silkstede is in sight, and the round
of the parishes is completed with King&rsquo;s Lane, turning to
the west from the high road to Winchester.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">WORDS AND PHRASES</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> entirely quitting the
parish, a few of the older words and forms of expression may be
recorded, chiefly as remembered from the older generation, for
&ldquo;the schoolmaster&rdquo; and the influx of new inhabitants
have changed much that was characteristic of the genuine West
Saxon.&nbsp; Nor, indeed, was there any very pronounced dialect,
like a separate language.&nbsp; The speech is slow, and with a
tendency to make <i>o</i> like <i>aa</i>, as Titus Oates does in
<i>Peveril of the Peak</i>.&nbsp; An Otterbourne man going into
Devonshire was told, &ldquo;My son, you speak
French.&rdquo;&nbsp; No one ever showed the true Hampshire
south-country speech and turn of expression so well as Lady
Verney in her <i>Lettice Lisle</i>, and she has truly Hampshire
characters too, such as could once easily be matched in these
villages.</p>

<p>If possible, a baby was short-coated on Good Friday, to ensure
not catching cold.</p>
<p>The old custom (now gone out) was that farmers should send
their men to church on Good Friday.&nbsp; They used all to appear
in their rough dirty smock frocks and go back to work
again.&nbsp; Some (of whom it would never have been expected)
would fast all day.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The 29th of May is still called Shick-shack day&mdash;why has
never been discovered.&nbsp; There must have been some observance
earlier than the Restoration, though oak-apples are still worn on
that day, and with their oak sprays are called Shick-shack.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On St. Clement&rsquo;s Day, the 23rd of November, explosions
of gunpowder are made on country blacksmiths&rsquo; anvils.&nbsp;
It is viewed as the blacksmiths&rsquo; holiday.&nbsp; The
accepted legend is that St. Clement was drowned with an anchor
hung to his neck, and that his body was found in a submarine
temple, from which the sea receded every seven years for the
benefit of pilgrims.&nbsp; Thus he became the patron of anchor
forgers, and thence of smiths in general.&nbsp; Charles Dickens,
in <i>Great Expectations</i> describes an Essex blacksmith as
working to a chant, the <i>refrain</i> of which was &ldquo;Old
Clem.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have heard the explosions at Hursley before
1860, but more modern blacksmiths despise the custom.&nbsp; At
Twyford, however, the festival is kept, and at the dinner a story
is read that after the Temple was finished, Solomon feasted all
the artificers except the blacksmiths, but they appeared, and
pointed out all that they had done in the way of necessary work,
on which they were included with high honour.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>St. Thomas&rsquo;s Day, 21st December, is still at Otterbourne
held as the day for &ldquo;gooding,&rdquo; when each poor
house-mother can demand sixpence from the well-to-do towards her
Christmas dinner.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Christmas mummers still perambulate the villages, somewhat
uncertainly, as their performance depends on the lads willing to
undertake it, and the willingness of some woman to undertake the
bedizening of them with strips of ribbon or coloured paper; and,
moreover, political allusions are sometimes introduced which
spoil the simplicity.&nbsp; The helmets are generally made of
wallpaper, in a shape like <i>auto-da-f&eacute;</i> caps, with
long strips hanging over so as to conceal the face, and over the
shirts are sewn streamers.</p>
<p>Thus tramp seven or eight lads, and stand drawn up in a row,
when the foremost advances with, at the top of his hoarse
voice:</p>
<blockquote><p>Room, room, brave gallants, room,<br />
I&rsquo;m just come to show you some merry sport and game,<br />
To help pass away<br />
This cold winter day.<br />
Old activity, new activity, such activity<br />
As never was seen before,<br />
And perhaps never will be seen no more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Alas! too probably.&nbsp; Thanks to the schoolmaster
abroad.)</p>
<p>Then either he or some other, equipped with a little imitation
snow, paces about announcing himself:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here comes I, Old Father Christmas, Christmas,
Christmas,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome or welcome not,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope old Father Christmas<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will never be forgot.<br />
All in this room, there shall be shown<br />
The dreadfullest battle that ever was known.<br />
So walk in, St. George, with thy free heart<br />
And see whether thou canst claim peace for thine own part.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far from &ldquo;claiming peace,&rdquo; St. George waves (or
ought to wave) his wooden sword, as he clumps forth,
exclaiming:</p>
<blockquote><p>In comes I, St. George, St. George, that man of
courage bold,<br />
With my broad sword and spear I won the crown of gold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fought that fiery dragon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And drove him to
the slaughter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And by that means I won<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The King of
Egypt&rsquo;s daughter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, if any man dare enter this door<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll hack him small as
dust,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And after send him to the cook&rsquo;s shop<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be made into mince-pie
crust!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On this defiance another figure appears:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here comes I, the Turkish knight<br />
Just come from Turkey land to fight;<br />
I&rsquo;ll fight thee, St. George, St. George, thou man of
courage bold,<br />
If thy blood be too hot, I&rsquo;ll quickly make it cold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which St. George responds, in the tone in which he would
address a cart-horse:</p>
<blockquote><p>Wo ho!&nbsp; My little fellow, thou talk&rsquo;st
very bold,<br />
Just like the little Turks, as I have been told,<br />
Therefore, thou Turkish knight,<br />
Pull out thy sword and fight,<br />
Pull out thy purse and pay,<br />
I&rsquo;ll have satisfaction, or thou guest away.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Turkish Knight</i>.</p>
<p>Satisfaction, no satisfaction at all,<br />
My head is made of iron, my body lined with steel,<br />
I&rsquo;ll battle thee, to see which on the ground shall
fall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two wooden swords clatter together till the Turkish knight
falls, all doubled up, even his sword, with due regard to his
finery; and St. George is so much shocked that he marches round,
lamenting:</p>
<blockquote><p>O only behold what I have been and done,<br />
Cut and slain my brother, just the evening sun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, bethinking himself, he exclaims:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have a little bottle, called elecampane,<br />
If the man is alive, let him rise and fight again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The application of the elecampane so far restores the Turkish
knight that he partly rises, entreating:</p>
<blockquote><p>O pardon me, St. George, O pardon me, I crave,<br
/>
O pardon me this once, and I will be thy slave.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very inconsistently with his late remorse, St. George
replies&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>I never will pardon a Turkish knight,<br />
Therefore arise, and try thy might.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The combat is renewed, and the Turkish knight falls prostrate,
on which the Foreign King comes forward, shouting:</p>
<blockquote><p>St. George, St. George, what hast thou done,<br />
For thou hast slain mine only son!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, after marching round the fallen hero, he cries:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is there a doctor to be found,<br />
That can cure this man lies bleeding on the ground?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In response, the doctor appears:</p>
<blockquote><p>O yes, there is a doctor to be found,<br />
That can cure this man lies bleeding on the ground.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The anxious father asks:</p>
<blockquote><p>Doctor, doctor, what is thy fee?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The doctor replies:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ten guineas is my fee,<br />
But ten pounds I&rsquo;ll take of thee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The king answers:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Take it, doctor, but what canst thou
cure?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The doctor&rsquo;s pretensions are high, for he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>I can cure the ague, palsy, and the gout,<br />
And that&rsquo;s a roving pain that goes within and out;<br />
A broken leg or arm, I soon can cure the pain,<br />
And if thou break&rsquo;st thy neck, I&rsquo;ll stoutly set it
again.<br />
Bring me an old woman of fourscore years and ten,<br />
Without a tooth in her head, I&rsquo;ll bring her young
again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The king observes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thou be&rsquo;st a noble doctor if
that&rsquo;s all true thou be&rsquo;st talking about.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the doctor, taking to prose, replies:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not like those little mountebank
doctors that go about the streets, and say this, that, and the
other, and tell you as many lies in one half-hour as you would
find in seven years; but what I does, I does clean before your
eyes, and ladies and gentlemen, if you won&rsquo;t believe your
own eyes, &rsquo;tis a very hard case.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The king agreeing that it is, the doctor goes to the patient,
saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have a little bottle that I call golden
foster drops.&nbsp; One drop on the root of this man&rsquo;s
tongue and another on his crown, will strike the heat through his
body, and raise him off the ground.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Accordingly the Turkish knight slowly rises and decamps, St.
George exclaiming:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Arise, arise, thou cowardly dog, and see
how uprightly thou can&rsquo;st stand.&nbsp; Go home into your
own country and tell them what old England has done for you, and
how they&rsquo;ll fight a thousand better men than
you.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This last speech may have been added after the Crimean War, as
the drama was copied out in 1857; but the staple of it was known
long before, though with variations, in different villages, and
it always concludes with little Johnny Jack, the smallest of the
troup, with a bundle of dolls on his back, going round with a
jingling money-box, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here comes I, little Johnny Jack,<br />
Wife and family at my back,<br />
My family&rsquo;s large though I am small,<br />
And so a little helps us all.<br />
Roast beef, plum pudding, strong beer and mince-pies,<br />
Who loves that better than Father Christmas or I?<br />
One mug of Christmas ale soon will make us merry and sing;<br />
Some money in our pockets will be a very fine thing.<br />
So, ladies and gentlemen, all at your ease,<br />
Give the Christmas boys just what you please.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before Christmas carols had to be reformed and regulated lest
they should be a mere occasion of profanity and rudeness, that
curious one of Dives and Lazarus was occasionally heard, of which
two lines could never be forgotten&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>He had no strength to drive them &rsquo;way,<br />
And so they licked his sores.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And when Lazarus afterwards sees &ldquo;Divers&rdquo;
&ldquo;sitting on a serpent&rsquo;s knee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>May Day too survived in a feeble state, with the little voices
singing:</p>
<blockquote><p>April&rsquo;s gone!&nbsp; May&rsquo;s come!<br />
Come and see our garland.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Keble improved the song into:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;April&rsquo;s gone, the king of
showers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May is come, the queen of flowers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me something, gentles dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For a blessing on the year.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For my garland give, I pray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Words and smiles of cheerful May;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Birds of spring, to you we come,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us pick a little crumb.<br />
In the dew of the morning we gathered our flowers<br />
From the woodlands and meadows and garden bowers,<br />
And now we have twisted our garland so gay,<br />
We are come here to wish you a happy May Day.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>We cannot but here add an outline of a village character from
<i>Old Times at Otterbourne</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. William Stainer was a baker.&nbsp; His bread
was excellent, and he was also noted for what were called
Otterbourne buns, the art of making which seems to have gone with
him.&nbsp; They were small fair-complexioned buns, which stuck
together in parties of three, and when soaked, expanded to twice
or three times their former size.&nbsp; He used to send them once
or twice a week to Winchester.&nbsp; But though baking was his
profession, he did much besides.&nbsp; He was a real
old-fashioned herbalist, and had a curious book on the virtues of
plants, and he made decoctions of many kinds, which he
administered to those in want of medicine.&nbsp; Before the Poor
Law provided Union doctors, medical advice, except at the
hospital, was almost out of reach of the poor.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs.
Yonge, like almost all other beneficent gentlefolks in villages,
kept a medicine chest and book, and doctored such cases as they
could venture on, and Mr. Stainer was in great favour as a
practitioner, as many of our elder people can remember.&nbsp; He
was exceedingly charitable and kind, and ready to give his help
so far as he could.&nbsp; He was a great lover of flowers, and
had contrived a sort of little greenhouse over the great oven at
the back of his house, and there he used to bring up lovely
geraniums and other flowers, which he sometimes sold.&nbsp; He
was a deeply religious and devout man, and during an illness of
the clerk took his place in Church, which was more important when
there was no choir and the singers sat in the gallery.&nbsp; He
was very happy in this office, moving about on felt shoes that he
might make no noise, and most reverently keeping the Church
clean, and watching over it in every way.&nbsp; He also continued
in the post of schoolmaster, which at first he had only taken
temporarily, and quaintly managing it.&nbsp; He was found setting
as a copy &ldquo;A blind man&rsquo;s wife needs no paint,&rdquo;
which he defended as &ldquo;Proverbs, sir, Proverbs.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Giving up part of his business to his nephew, he still sat up at
night baking, for the nephew, he said, was only in the A B C book
of baking, and he also had other troubles: there was insanity in
his family, and he was much harassed.&nbsp; His kindness and
simplicity were sometimes abused.&nbsp; He never had the heart to
refuse to lend money, or to deny bread on credit to hopeless
debtors; and altogether debts, distress, baking, and watching his
sisters all night, and school keeping all day, were too much for
him.&nbsp; The first hint of an examination of his school
completed the mischief and he died insane, drowning himself in
the canal.&nbsp; It is a sad story, but many of us will remember
with affectionate regard the good, kind, quaint, and most
excellent little man.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>A few lines, half parody, half original, may be added as
picturing the old aspect of Otterbourne, about 1830:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">OLD REMEMBRANCES</p>
<p class="poetry">I remember, I remember,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Old times at Otterbourne,<br />
Before the building of the Church,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And when smock frocks were worn!</p>
<blockquote><p>I remember, I remember,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When railroads there were none,<br />
When by stage coach at early dawn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The journey was begun.</p>
<p>And through the turnpike roads till eve<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Trotted the horses four,<br />
With inside passengers and out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They carried near a score.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red Rover&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Telegraph,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We knew them all by name,<br />
And Mason&rsquo;s and the Oxford coach,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Full thirty of them came.</p>
<p>The coachman wore his many capes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The guard his bugle blew;<br />
The horses were a gallant sight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dashing upon our view.</p>
<p>I remember, I remember,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The posting days of old;<br />
The yellow chariot lined with blue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And lace of colour gold.</p>
<p>The post-boys&rsquo; jackets blue or buff,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The inns upon the road;<br />
The hills up which we used to walk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To lighten thus the load.</p>
<p>The rattling up before the inn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The horses led away,<br />
The post-boy as he touched his hat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And came to ask his pay.</p>
<p>The perch aloft upon the box,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Delightful for the view;<br />
The turnpike gates whose keepers stood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Demanding each his due.</p>
<p>I remember, I remember,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When ships were beauteous things,<br />
The floating castles of the deep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Borne upon snow-white wings;</p>
<p>Ere iron-dads and turret ships,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ugly as evil dream,<br />
Became the hideous progeny<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of iron and of steam.</p>
<p>You crossed the Itchen ferry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All in an open boat,<br />
Now, on a panting hissing bridge<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You scarcely seem afloat.</p>
<p>Southampton docks were sheets of mud,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Grim colliers at the quay.<br />
No tramway, and no slender pier <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To stretch into the sea.</p>
<p>I remember, I remember,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Long years ere Rowland Hill,<br />
When letters covered quarto sheets <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Writ with a grey goose quill;</p>
<p>Both hard to fold and hard to read, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Crossed to the scarlet seal;<br />
Hardest of all to pay for, ere<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their news they might reveal.</p>
<p>No stamp with royal head was there, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But eightpence was the sum<br />
For every letter, all alike,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That did from London come!</p>
<p>I remember, I remember,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The mowing of the hay;<br />
Scythes sweeping through the heavy grass <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At breaking of the day.</p>
<p>The haymakers in merry ranks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tossing the swathes so sweet,<br />
The haycocks tanning olive-brown <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In glowing summer heat.</p>
<p>The reapers &rsquo;mid the ruddy wheat, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The thumping of the flail,<br />
The winnowing within the barn <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By whirling round a sail.</p>
<p>Long ere the whirr, and buzz, and rush <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Became a harvest sound,<br />
Or monsters trailed their tails of spikes, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or ploughed the fallow ground.</p>
<p>Our sparks flew from the flint and steel, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No lucifers were known,<br />
Snuffers with tallow candles came <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To prune the wick o&rsquo;ergrown.</p>
<p>Hands did the work of engines then, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But now some new machine<br />
Must hatch the eggs, and sew the seams, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And make the cakes, I ween.</p>
<p>I remember, I remember,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The homely village school,<br />
The dame with spelling book and rod, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sceptre of her rule.</p>
<p>A black silk bonnet on her head, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Buff kerchief on her neck,<br />
With spectacles upon her nose, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And apron of blue check.</p>
<p>Ah, then were no inspection days, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No standards then were known,<br />
Children could freely make dirt pies, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And learning let alone!</p>
<p>Those Sundays I remember too,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When Service there was one; <br />
For living in the parish then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of parsons there were none.</p>
<p>And oh, I can recall to mind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Church and every pew; <br />
William and Mary&rsquo;s royal arms<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hung up in fullest view.</p>
<p>The lion smiling, with his tongue <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a pug dog&rsquo;s hung out;<br />
The unicorn with twisted horn, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Brooding upon his rout.</p>
<p>Exalted in the gallery high <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The tuneful village choir,<br />
With flute, bassoon, and clarionet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their notes rose high and higher.</p>
<p>They shewed the number of the Psalm <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In white upon a slate,<br />
And many a time the last lines sung <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Brady and of Tate.</p>
<p>While far below upon the floor <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Along the narrow aisle,<br />
The children on their benches sat <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Arranged in single file.</p>
<p>And there the clerk would stump along <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And strike with echoing blow<br />
Each idle guilty little head<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That chattered loud or low.</p>
<p>Ah!&nbsp; I remember many things, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Old, middle-aged, and new;<br />
Is the new better than the old, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; More bright, more wise, more true?</p>
<p>The old must ever pass away, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The new must still come in;<br />
When these new things are old to you <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be they unstained by sin.</p>
<p>So will their memory be sweet, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A treasury of bliss<br />
To be borne with us in the days <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When we their presence miss.</p>
<p>Trifles connected with the love <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of many a vanished friend<br />
Will thrill the heart and wake the sense, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For memory has no end!</p>

190</span>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">NATURAL HISTORY</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Or</span> animal life, though abundant,
there is little or nothing special to record, besides the list of
birds.</p>
<p>Polecats and martens only exist in the old rating book, but
weasels and stoats remain, as well as a profusion of their
prey&mdash;hares and rabbits.&nbsp; Squirrels haunt the trees,
and otters are occasionally found in the river.&nbsp; Trout,
grayling, now and then a pike, as well as the smaller fry of
minnows and sticklebacks, are of course found in the
streams.&nbsp; Eels used to be caught there on the moonlight
nights by old labourers with a taste for sport, and the quaint
little river cray-fish may be picked out of the banks of the
&ldquo;water-carriages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toads and frogs are a matter of course.&nbsp; Sometimes a
procession of tiny, but perfectly formed &ldquo;Charley
Frogs,&rdquo; as the village boys call them, just emerged from
their tadpole state, may be seen making their way up from their
native pools.</p>
<p>The pretty crested newt, dark brown and orange, with a gold
crest along its back like an iguana, is found in shallow ponds,
also the smooth newt.&nbsp; These efts, or evvets, as the people
call them, are regarded with horror by the peasantry.&nbsp; The
children speak of having seen one as if it were a crocodile; and
an abscess in the arm has been ascribed to having picked up an
&ldquo;evvet in a bundle of grass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The slow-worm, in silvery coat, is too often slaughtered as a
snake.&nbsp; Vipers come to light in the woods, also the harmless
brown snake.&nbsp; One of these has been seen swimming across a
pond, his head just out of the water, another climbing an oak
tree, and one, upon the lawn, was induced to disgorge a frog,
which gathered up its legs and hopped away as if nothing had
happened.</p>
<p>Of rats and mice and such small deer there are only too many,
though it is worth while to watch rats at play round a hay-rick
on Sunday evenings, when they know they will not be persecuted,
and sit up like little kangaroos.&nbsp; The vole, which is not a
rat, is a goodly sight, and the smooth round dormouse (or
sleep-mouse, as the children call it) is a favourite gift
imprisoned in an old tea-pot.</p>
<p>The beautiful nest of a field-mouse has been found in a
cypress&rsquo;s thick foliage, and dead shrews bestrew the paths;
though the magic effects of having a &ldquo;sherry mouse&rdquo;
die in one&rsquo;s hand, and thus being enabled to stroke cattle
and cure them, have never been experienced.</p>
<p>The <i>anodon</i> or fresh water mussel used to be found in
Fisher&rsquo;s Pond on Colden Common, bordering on Otterbourne,
and the green banks were strewn with shells left by the herons,
but the pond is fast drying up and the herons have been driven
away by guns.</p>
<p>The delicate <i>paludina</i>, of brown, horn-coloured,
gracefully-formed shell, creeps on the water weeds, and hosts of
snails may be studied.</p>
<p>Of insects less can be said here, but it is worth noting that
one live purple emperor has been captured in Ampfield wood, two
dead dilapidated ones picked up at Otterbourne.</p>
<p>The forest fly, so called, does not often come here; but it is
observable that while strange horses are maddened by it, the
native ones do not seem disturbed, knowing that it only creeps
and does not bite.&nbsp; It is small and brown, not so formidable
looking as the large fly, popularly called a stout, as big as a
hornet, which lays eggs under the skin of cows.</p>
<p>But with the blue, green, and orange dragonflies of summer,
this list must conclude, and turn to the birds and botany of the
place, mostly well known, and verified by Mr. Townsend&rsquo;s
<i>Flora of Hampshire</i>.</p>
<h3>BIRDS</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The Kite</span> (<i>Milvus
ictinus</i>).&mdash;Sometimes hovering over heathlands or
farmyards, but not very common.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sparrow-Hawk</span> (<i>Accipiter
fringillarius</i>).&mdash;Taken in a trap set for rats at
Otterbourne House.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Peregrine Falcon</span> (<i>Falco
peregrinus</i>), Hursley, 1857.&mdash;As a pair for many years
had a nest on Salisbury spire, this one may have flown thus
far.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kestrel</span> (<i>Falco
tinnunculus</i>)&mdash;Otterbourne, 1856.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Short-Eared Owl</span> (<i>Otus
brachyotus</i>).&mdash;Baddesley Common, 5th March 1861.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">White Owl</span> (<i>Strix
flammea</i>).&mdash;Nested in a barn, another year in a
pigeon-loft, and again in an old tub at Otterbourne.&nbsp; To be
seen skimming softly along on summer evenings.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brown Owl</span> (<i>Ulula
stridula</i>).&mdash;Glides over the fields like a huge moth, and
on moonlight nights in August may be heard the curious hunting
note.&nbsp; As the eggs are hatched, not all at once, but in
succession, a family taken out of a loft and put into a sea-kale
pot were of various ages, the eldest nearly fledged, standing up
as if to guard the nest, the second hissing and snapping, as if a
naughty boy, and two downy infants who died.&nbsp; One brown owl
was kept tame, and lived 14 years.&nbsp; The village people call
this bird Screech Owl, and after a sudden death always mention
having heard it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chimney Swallow</span> (<i>Hirundo
rustica</i>).&mdash;They chase the flies under the bridges on the
Itchen, and display their red throats.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">House-Martin</span> (<i>Hirundo
urbica</i>).&mdash;Twittering everywhere &rsquo;neath the
straw-built shed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sand-Martin</span> (<i>Hirundo
riparia</i>).&mdash;Swarms sit in rows along the electric wires,
and bore deeply into every sand-pit.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Swift</span> (<i>Cypselus
murarius</i>).&mdash;First to come and first to go.&nbsp; Their
peculiar screech and floating flight are one of the charms of the
summer evenings.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nightjar</span> (<i>Caprimulgus
europ&aelig;us</i>).&mdash;All through the twilight of the long
days his purr-purr comes down from the heathery summit of
Otterbourne Hill, where he earns his other name of Fern Owl, and
may be seen flitting on silent wing in search of moths.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kingfisher</span> (<i>Alcedo
ispida</i>).&mdash;This beautiful creature darts out of the reeds
bordering the Itchen, and it used to be at Chandler&rsquo;s Ford
before the place was so populated.&nbsp; It seems also to haunt
ponds or marshy places in woods, for a young full-fledged one was
brought into Otterbourne House by a cat, alive and apparently
unhurt.&nbsp; Another took a fancy to the gold-fish in a stone
basin at Cranbury, and was shot, as the poor fish could not
escape.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Spotted Flycatcher</span> (<i>Muscicapa
grisola</i>).&mdash;Late in summer these dainty little birds come
whisking about the garden, perching on a rail, darting off after
a fly, returning to the same post, or else feeding their young in
nests on the side of the house.&nbsp; A pair built in 1897 in a
flower-pot close to the window of Otterbourne House.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Butcher-Bird</span> (<i>Lanius
collurio</i>).&mdash;Said to have been seen at Otterbourne.&nbsp;
A slug has been found impaled on a thorn, but whether this was
the shrike&rsquo;s larder, or as a charm for removing warts, is
uncertain.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Missel-Thrush</span> (<i>Merula
viscivora</i>).&mdash;This handsome bird is frequent, and
commonly called House Screech.&nbsp; A story told by Warden
Barter may be worth preserving.&nbsp; A pair of Missel Thrush
seeing a peacock too near their nest, charged full at him, and
actually knocked him down.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Song-Thrush</span> (<i>Merula
musica</i>).&mdash;Happily everywhere warbling on warm days in
autumn and winter with a sweet, powerful song, some notes more
liquid than even the nightingale&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The shells of the
snails he has devoured bestrew the garden-walks.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Blackbird</span> (<i>Merula
vulgaris</i>).&mdash;Out, with angry scream and chatter at the
approach of an enemy, darts the &ldquo;ousel cock so black of
hue, with orange-tawny bill.&rdquo;&nbsp; How dull a lawn would
be without his pert movements when he comes down alternately with
his russet wife.&nbsp; One blackbird with a broad white feather
on each side of his tail haunted Elderfield for two years, but,
alas! one spring day a spruce sable rival descended and
captivated the faithless dame.&nbsp; They united, chased poor Mr.
Whitetail over the high garden hedge, and he was seen no
more.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Redwing</span> (<i>Merula
iliaca</i>).&mdash;Not common, but noted by J. B. Y.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ring-Ouzel</span> (<i>Merula
torquata</i>).&mdash;Rare, but observed by J. B. Yonge in
Otterbourne Park, 14th September 1865, and it has been seen
several times later.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fieldfare</span> (<i>Merula
pilaris</i>).&mdash;In flocks in winter.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Wheatear</span> (<i>Sylvia
&aelig;nanthe</i>).&mdash;Comes to the downs.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Stonechat</span> (<i>Saxicola
rubicola</i>).&mdash;Hops about on stones.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Whinchat</span> (<i>Saxicola
rubetra</i>).&mdash;On furze bushes on Otterbourne Hill.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Redbreast</span> (<i>Sylvia
rubecula</i>).&mdash;A whole brood, two old and four young, used
to disport themselves on the quilt of an old bedridden woman on
Otterbourne Hill.&nbsp; It is the popular belief that robins kill
their fathers in October, and the widow of a woodman declared
that her husband had seen deadly battles, also that he had seen a
white robin, but she possibly romanced.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Redstart</span> (<i>Ph&aelig;nicura
ruticilla</i>).&mdash;Sometimes seen, but not often.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Grasshopper-Warbler</span> (<i>Salicaria
locustella</i>).&mdash;Well named, for it chirps exactly like a
grasshopper in the laurels all through a summer evening.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sedge-Warbler</span> (<i>Salicaria
fragilis</i>).&mdash;Whoever has heard it scolding and chattering
in a ridiculous rage at a strange footstep will not wonder at the
Scotch name of Blethering Jock.&nbsp; A pair nested in Dell Copse
for some years, and the curious nest has been found among the
reeds on the banks of the Itchen.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nightingale</span> (<i>Sylvia
luscinia</i>).&mdash;Every year about the 18th of April the notes
may be heard by the gate of Cranbury, in a larch wood on
Otterbourne Hill, in the copse wood of Otterbourne House, at
Oakwood, and elsewhere.&nbsp; For about a week there is constant
song, but after nesting begins, it is less frequent.&nbsp; One
year there was a nest in the laurels at Otterbourne House (since
taken away), and at eight in the morning and seven at night the
nightingale came on the lawn to feed, and was every morning
chased by a surly John Bull of a robin.&nbsp; When the young are
coming out of the nest the parents chide them, or strangers, in a
peculiarly harsh chirp.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Blackcap</span> (<i>Sylvia
atricapilla</i>).&mdash;Fair and sweet, but not very frequent;
nested in Dell Copse.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Whitethroat</span> (<i>Sylvia
cinerea</i>).&mdash;Darts about gardens, and is locally called
Nettle-creeper.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lesser Whitethroat</span> (<i>S.
curruca</i>).&mdash;Eggs in Dell Copse.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Wood-Warbler</span> (<i>Sylvia
sylvicola</i>).&mdash;Eggs taken at Cranbury.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Willow-Warbler</span> (<i>Sylvia
trochilus</i>).&mdash;Eggs taken at Baddesley.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chiefchaff</span> (<i>Sylvia
hippola&iuml;s</i>).&mdash;Common in spring.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Golden-Crested Wren</span> (<i>Sylvia
auricapilla</i>).&mdash;A happy little inhabitant of the
fir-trees, where it nests, and it is often to be seen darting in
and out of a quickset hedge.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Skylark</span> (<i>Alauda
arvensis</i>).&mdash;The joy of eyes and ears in every open
field.&nbsp; True to the kindred points of heaven and home.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Woodlark</span> (<i>Alauda
arborea</i>).&mdash;Otterbourne Park and Cranbury.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Yellow-Bunting</span> or <span
class="smcap">Yellow-Hammer</span> (<i>Emberiza
citrinella</i>).&mdash;A great ornament, especially in autumn,
when it sits on rails, crying, &ldquo;A little bit of bread and
no che-e-ese!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Blackheaded</span> or <span
class="smcap">Reed Bunting</span> (<i>Emberiza
sch&aelig;nidus</i>).&mdash;Brambridge, April 1896.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sparrow</span> (<i>Passer
domesticus</i>).&mdash;One curious fact about this despised
animal is that the retired farmer, after whom Elderfield is
named, made it his business to exterminate the village
sparrows.&nbsp; He often brought them down to one, but always by
the next morning that sparrow had provided himself with a mate to
share his Castle Dangerous.&nbsp; Sparrows&rsquo; (or
sprows&rsquo;) heads make a figure in many church ratebooks.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chaffinch</span> (<i>Fringilla
c&aelig;lebs</i>).&mdash;Chink is the Hampshire name.&nbsp; The
hens do not here migrate in winter, but a whole flight of them
has been seen in the autumn on the Winchester road, evidently on
their way; and once, after an early severe frost, about a hundred
were found dead in a haystack near Basingstoke.&nbsp; Thomas
Chamberlayne, Esq., who had a singular attraction for birds, used
to have them coming to eat grain from his pocket.&nbsp; It has
the perfection of a nest.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Goldfinch</span> (<i>Carduelis
elegans</i>).&mdash;This exquisite little bird is frequent on the
borders of the chalk hills, where there is plenty of
thistledown.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hawfinch</span> (<i>Coccothraustes
vulgaris</i>).&mdash;Sometimes seen, but not common.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Linnet</span> (<i>Linota
cannabina</i>).&mdash;Fairly frequent.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Green Linnet</span> (<i>Coccothraustes
chloris</i>).&mdash;Greenfinch, or Beanbird as they call it in
Devonshire, is a pleasant visitor, though it has a great turn for
pease.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Wren</span> (<i>Sylvia
troglodytes</i>).&mdash;This brisk little being Kitty Wren is to
be seen everywhere.&nbsp; Whether Kingsley&rsquo;s theory is
right that the little birds roll themselves into a ball in a hole
in the winter, I know not.&nbsp; Single ones are certainly to be
seen on a bank on a frosty, sunshiny day.&nbsp; Have they come
out to view the world and report on it?&nbsp; Those very odd,
unused nests are often to be found hanging from the thatch within
outhouses.&nbsp; May it be recorded here that a wren once came to
peck the sprigs on Miss Keble&rsquo;s gown?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Great Titmouse</span> (<i>Parus
major</i>)&mdash;or Ox-eye, as he is here called, bold and
bright, crying &ldquo;Peter&rdquo; in early spring, and beautiful
with his white cheek, and the black bar down his yellow
waistcoat.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Blue Tit</span> (<i>Parus
c&aelig;ruleus</i>).&mdash;Bolder and prettier is the little
blue-cap, a true sprite and acrobat as Wordsworth calls him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marsh-Tit</span> (<i>Parus
palustris</i>).&mdash;Known by less bright colouring and white
breast.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Cole-Tit</span> (<i>Parus
ater</i>).&mdash;More grey, and very graceful.&nbsp; All these
four will gladly come to a window in winter for a little fat hung
to a string, and will put themselves into wonderful inverse
positions.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Long-Tailed Tit</span> (<i>Parus
caudatus</i>).&mdash;Long-tailed Caper, as is his local name, is
more shy, and will not come to be fed; but the antics of a family
after they have left their domed nest are delightful to watch, as
they play in the boughs of a fir-tree.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hedge-Sparrow</span> (<i>Accentur
modularis</i>).&mdash;Quiet, mottled bird, to be seen
everywhere.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pied Wagtail</span> (<i>Motacilla
lutor</i>).&mdash;Most of these stay with us all winter, but one
March evening at least forty-three descended on the lawn at
Elderfield, doubtless halting in their flight from southern
lands.&nbsp; Most winning birds they are, with their lively hop
and jerking tails.&nbsp; Dish-washer is their Hampshire name.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Grey Wagtail</span> (<i>Motacilla
boarula</i>).&mdash;This pretty bird is really partly
yellow.&nbsp; It is not very frequent here, but is sometimes
found on the Itchen bank; likewise the nest in a reedy
meadow.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ray&rsquo;s Wagtail</span> (<i>Motacilla
Rayi</i>).&mdash;Ray&rsquo;s Wagtail was catching flies on a
window at Otterbourne House in 1890.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Tree Pitt</span> (<i>Anthus arboreus</i>),
<span class="smcap">Meadow Pipit</span> (<i>Anthus
pratensis</i>).&mdash;Small brown birds, not easy to distinguish;
but the eggs differ, and both have been found.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bullfinch</span> (<i>Pyrrhula
vulgaris</i>).&mdash;It is charming to greet the black head and
red waistcoat in the tops of the laurels or apple-trees, and
surely this destroyer of insect devourers does more good than
harm, if he does pick the buds to pieces in the search.&nbsp; He
is a delightful pet, of exclusive and jealous attachments, hating
every one except his own peculiar favourite; and his
sober-coloured lady has quite as much character as he.&nbsp; One
which was devoted to her own mistress would assail another of the
family with such spite as sometimes to drive her out of the
room.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Starling</span> (<i>Sturnus
vulgaris</i>).&mdash;Green bedropped with gold when seen closely,
but at a distance looking more like a rusty blackbird, though its
gait on the lawn always distinguishes it, being a walk instead of
a hop.&nbsp; Though not tuneful, no bird has such a variety of
notes, and the clatter on the root the call-note, the impatient
summons of the brood about to be fed, make it a most amusing
neighbour, when it returns to the same tree year after year.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Raven</span> (<i>Corvus
corax</i>).&mdash;He has flown over the village several
times.&nbsp; One lived for many years in the yard of the George
Inn at Winchester.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Crow</span> (<i>Corvus
coron&aelig;</i>).&mdash;Game-preserving has nearly put an end to
him, but he is seen round the folds on the downs in lambing
time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rook</span> (<i>Corvus
frugilegus</i>).&mdash;Shining and black the great birds come
down on the fields.&nbsp; There is a rookery at Cranbury, another
at Hams Farm at Allbrook, and a considerable one in the beeches
near Merdon, for which the rooks deserted some oak-trees nearer
the House.&nbsp; While these trees were still inhabited, Mr. G.
W. Heathcote observed a number of walnuts under them, and found
that the rooks brought them from the walnut avenues.&nbsp; A
parliament of these wise birds is sometimes held on the downs,
and there are woods where they assemble in great numbers in the
autumn, contingents from all lesser rookeries pouring in to spend
the winter, and whirling round and round in clouds before
roosting.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jackdaw</span> (<i>Corvus
monedula</i>).&mdash;A very amusing, though very wicked
pet.&nbsp; There used to be throngs of them in the tower of the
old church at Hursley, and their droll voices might be heard
conversing in the evening.&nbsp; Mr. Chamberlayne had one which,
after being freed, always came down to greet him when he walked
in the garden.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Magpie</span> (<i>Corvus
pica</i>).&mdash;Pages might be filled with the merry mischief of
this handsome creature.&nbsp; Perhaps the most observable
characteristic of the three tame ones closely observed was their
exclusive and devoted attachment to one person, whom they singled
out for no cause that could be known, and followed about from
place to place.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jay</span> (<i>Garrulus
glandarius</i>).&mdash;May be heard calling in the pine
plantations on Hursley Common.&nbsp; It would be as amusing as
the magpie if tamed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Green Woodpecker</span> (<i>Picus
viridis</i>).&mdash;The laugh and the tap may be heard all
through the Spring days.&nbsp; In 1890 <i>Picus major</i>, a
small, black, and spotted French Magpie, as Devonians call it,
was found, but we have no other right to claim it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Wryneck</span> (<i>Yunx torquilla</i>), or
Cuckoo&rsquo;s mate, squeaks all round the woods with his head on
one side just as the cuckoo comes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nuthatch</span> (<i>Sitta
europ&aelig;a</i>).&mdash;This pretty creature will come and be
fed on nuts at windows in the winter.&nbsp; These nuts he thrusts
into crevices of bark to hold them fast while he hammers the
shell.&nbsp; The remains may often be found.&nbsp; For many years
a pair built in a hole half-way down an old apple-tree covered
with ivy at Otterbourne House, and the exertions of the magpie
with clipped wing to swing himself on a trail of ivy into the
hole were comical, as well as his wrath when he fell off, as he
uniformly did.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Tree-Creeper</span> (<i>Certhia
familiaris</i>), winds round and round the trees like a little
mouse.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hoopoe</span> (<i>Upupa
vulgaris</i>).&mdash;Once in a frost caught alive by a shepherd
on the downs, but it soon died.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Cuckoo</span> (<i>Cuculus
canorus</i>).&mdash;They cuckoo till &ldquo;in June he altereth
his tune.&rdquo;&nbsp; Probably the stammer is the effort of the
young ones to sing.&nbsp; One grew up in a wagtail&rsquo;s nest
in the flints that were built into the wall of Otterbourne
Churchyard.&nbsp; Another, carried to the other side of the road
and caged, was still fed by its foster-parents till it was ready
to fly.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Wood-Pigeon</span> (<i>Columba
palumbus</i>)&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Take two cows, Taffy,<br />
Taffy, take two-o-o.</p>
<p>Plenty of this immoral exhortation may be heard in the
trees.&nbsp; One young pigeon taken from the nest proved
incorrigibly wild and ready to flutter to death whenever any one
came near it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Turtle-Dove</span> (<i>Columba
turtur</i>).&mdash;This pretty delicate creature with speckled
neck builds in bushes lower than the wood-pigeon, and the
mournful note resounds in the trees.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pheasant</span> (<i>Phasianus
colchicus</i>).&mdash;Not a real native, but cultivated to any
extent.&nbsp; A cock pheasant with the evening sun gilding his
back is a rare picture of beauty.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Partridge</span> (<i>Tetrao
perdix</i>).&mdash;Numerous.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Heron</span> (<i>Ardea
cinerea</i>).&mdash;Sometimes flies far overhead, the long legs
projecting behind.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sandpiper</span> (<i>Totanus
hypoleucus</i>).&mdash;Seen walking over a mass of weeds in the
Itchen canal.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Snipe</span> (<i>Scolopax
gallinago</i>).&mdash;Brought in by sportsmen from the water
meadows.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Woodcock</span> (<i>Scolopax
rusticola</i>).&mdash;Not common, but sometimes shot.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jack-Snipe</span> (<i>Scolopax
gallinula</i>).&mdash;Not common, but sometimes shot.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Land-Rail</span> (<i>Crex
pratensis</i>).&mdash;Corn-Crake.&nbsp; May be heard
&ldquo;craking&rdquo; in the long grass in early morning before
the hay is cut.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Water-Rail</span> (<i>Rallus
aquaticus</i>).&mdash;In a meadow at Otterbourne, 22nd January
1855.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Little Grebe</span> (<i>Podiceps
minor</i>).&mdash;Dabchick, as it is commonly called, swims in
the Itchen and in Fisher&rsquo;s Pond (on Colden Common), dipping
down suddenly without a trace of the least alarm.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moor-Hen</span> (<i>Gallinula
chloropus</i>).&mdash;Very similar are the ways of the moor-hen,
with its brilliant beak.&nbsp; But once, by some extraordinary
chance, a moor-hen fell down a cottage chimney, and was brought
alive for inspection by a boy, who, ignorant of natural objects,
as was always the case in villages forty years ago, thought it a
rare foreign specimen.&nbsp; It was a thatched cottage, but if it
had been slated the moor-hen might have taken the roof for a
sheet of water by moonlight, as the Great Water-Beetle has been
known to do, and come down the chimney in like manner.&nbsp; A
brood comes constantly to be fed on a lawn at Bishopstoke.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Peewit</span> (<i>Vanellus
cristatus</i>).&mdash;Otherwise the Crested Lapwing.&nbsp; It
floats along in numbers when migrating, the whole flock turning
at the same time and displaying either the dark or the white side
of their wings with a startling effect.&nbsp; They seem effaced
for a moment, the next the white sails are shown, then gone
again.&nbsp; When paired, and nesting in the meadows, their cry
causes their local name, as their other English title is derived
from their characteristic man&oelig;uvres to lead the enemy from
their young.&nbsp; Did they learn the habit when their so-called
plovers&rsquo; eggs became a dainty?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Golden Plover</span> (<i>Charadrius
pluvialis</i>).&mdash;Noted at Otterbourne meadows by J. B.
Yonge.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Wild Duck</span> (<i>Anas
boschas</i>).&mdash;The mallard is splendid in plumage, and in
shape is far more graceful than his domesticated brother.&nbsp;
In early winter the wild ducks fly overhead in a wedge-shaped
phalanx, and by and by they pair, and if disturbed start up with
a sudden quack, quack from the copse-wood pond.&nbsp; Broods of
downy wild ducks have been brought in by boys, but it has almost
always proved impossible to rear them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Teal</span> (<i>Querquedula
anas</i>).&mdash;This very pretty little duck used to build on
Cranbury Common, but may have been frightened away by increasing
population.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gull</span> (<i>Larus
canus</i>).&mdash;Flocks of those white-breasted birds sometimes
alight on ploughed fields round Otterbourne, and even some miles
farther from the sea.&nbsp; They are sometimes kept in gardens to
destroy the slugs.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>These birds have all been actually seen and noted down by
members of the Yonge family.</p>
<h3>FLOWERS</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Traveller&rsquo;s Joy</span> (<i>Clematis
Vitalba</i>).&mdash;Locally called Old Man&rsquo;s Beard, most
appropriately, as its curling, silvery masses of seeds hang in
wreaths over the hedges.&nbsp; There is a giant trunk growing up
from the moat of Merdon Castle.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Meadow Rue</span> (<i>Thalictrum
flavum</i>).&mdash;Handsome foliage and blossoms, showing much of
anthers, growing on the banks of the Itchen canal.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Windflower</span> (<i>Anemone
nemorosa</i>).&mdash;Smellfoxes, as the villagers&rsquo; children
inelegantly term this elegant flower, spreading its pearl-white
blossom, by means of its creeping root, all over the copses, and
blushing purple as the season advances.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Water Crowfoot</span> (<i>Ranunculus
aquatilis</i>).&mdash;The white flowers, with yellow eyes, make
quite a sheet over the ponds of Cranbury Common, etc.&nbsp;
Ivy-leaved (<i>R. hederaceus</i>).&mdash;Not so frequent.&nbsp;
The ivy-shaped leaves float above, the long fibrous ones go
below.&nbsp; When there is lack of moisture, leaves and flower
are sometimes so small that it has been supposed to be a
different species.&nbsp; It was once in a stagnant pond in Boyatt
Lane, but is extinct again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Buttercup</span> or <span
class="smcap">Crowfoot</span>&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>R. sceleratus</i>) Highly-polished petals, which
spangle</p>
<p>(<i>R. acris</i>) the fields and hedges with gold.</p>
<p>(<i>R. repens</i>) All much alike; all haunting</p>
<p>(<i>R. bulbosus</i>) kitchen-gardens and pastures, where the
cattle, disliking their taste, leave the stems standing up
alone.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Spearwort</span> (<i>R.
flammula</i>).&mdash;Flower like the others, but with narrow
leaves.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Goldilocks</span> (<i>R.
auricomus</i>).&mdash;More delicate, upper leaves spear-shaped,
lower pinnate.&nbsp; In the borders of the copse wood of
Otterbourne House.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Corn Crowfoot</span> (<i>R.
Ficaria</i>).&mdash;Small, growing between the corn with hooked
capsules.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Small Celandine</span> (<i>R.
Bcaria</i>).&mdash;The real buttercup of childhood, with its
crown of numerous shining petals, making stars along the banks at
the first breath of spring.&nbsp; One of the most welcome of
flowers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">King Cups</span> (<i>Caltha
palustris</i>).&mdash;Large, gorgeous flowers, in every wet
place, making a golden river in a dell at Cranbury.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Green Hellebore</span> (<i>Helleborus
viridis</i>).&mdash;Under an oak-tree, in a hedgerow leading from
King&rsquo;s Lane, Standon, and in Hursley.</p>

lutea</i>).&mdash;An old wall at Hursley.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Climbing</span> F. (<i>Corydalis
claviculata</i>).&mdash;Cuckoo bushes.&nbsp; Standon, and in
Hursley.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Columbine</span> (<i>Aquilegia
vulgaris</i>).&mdash;This group of purple doves, or of Turkish
slippers, does not here merit the term <i>vulgaris</i>, though,
wherever it occurs, it is too far from a garden to be a
stray.&nbsp; Ampfield Wood, Lincoln&rsquo;s Copse, King&rsquo;s
Lane, and Crabwood have each furnished a specimen.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barberry</span> (<i>Berberis
vulgaris</i>).&mdash;This handsome shrub of yellow wood, delicate
clusters of yellow flowers, and crimson fruit in long oval
bunches has been sedulously banished from an idea that it poisons
grass in its vicinity.&nbsp; There used to be a bush in
Otterbourne House grounds, but it has disappeared, and only one
now remains in the hedge of Pitt Downs.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Poppy</span> (<i>Papaver
Rh&aelig;as</i>).&mdash;Making neglected fields glorious with a
crimson mantle, visible for miles in the sun.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Greater Celandine</span> (<i>Chelidonium
majus</i>).&mdash;Yellow flowers, very frail, handsome pinnate
leaf&mdash;lane at Brambridge, Standon, and in Hursley.</p>

alliaria</i>).&mdash;Seen at Brambridge.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady&rsquo;s Smock</span> (<i>Cardamine
pratensis</i>).&mdash;No doubt named because the pearly flowers
look on a moist meadow like linen bleaching.&nbsp; Sometimes
double in rich ground.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hairy Cardamine</span> (<i>C.
hirsuta</i>).&mdash;Hursley.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Yellow Rocket</span> (<i>Barbarea
vulgaris</i>).&mdash;Road near Chandler&rsquo;s Ford.&nbsp; Near
bridge over Itchen.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Watercress</span> (<i>Nasturtium
officinale</i>).&mdash;Everywhere in running water, and now
Poolhole is made into a nursery for it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Shepherd&rsquo;s Purse</span> (<i>Thlaspi
Bursa-pastoris</i>).&mdash;Even the purses are to be seen before
we well know the tiny white flowers to be in blossom.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pennycress</span> (<i>T.
arvense</i>).&mdash;Larger, and uplifting a spike of rounded,
fan-shaped capsules.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Wild Mignonette</span> (<i>Reseda
lutea</i>).&mdash;Mignonette all but the
perfume&mdash;chalk-pits.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dyer&rsquo;s Rocket</span> (<i>R.
luteola</i>).&mdash;Slenderer and more spiked; more common.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rock Rose</span> (<i>Helianthemum
vulgare</i>).&mdash;There is an elegance and delicacy of colour
about this little cistus which renders it one of the most
charming of the many stars of the wayside, as it grows on Compton
Hill.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sweet Violet</span> (<i>Viola
odorata</i>).&mdash;The colour, purple or white or pink, seems to
depend on the soil.&nbsp; White are the most common on the chalky
side, blue on the gravel.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marsh</span> V. (<i>V.
palustris</i>).&mdash;Small and pale, with round leaves.&nbsp;
Seen at a spring in Otterbourne Park.&nbsp; (<i>V.
permixta</i>).&mdash;Pinky&mdash;Kiln-yard, Otterbourne.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dog</span> V. (<i>V. canina</i>).&mdash;In
every wood, rich and handsome.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Snake</span> V. (<i>V.
hirta</i>).&mdash;More delicate and small, growing in
turf&mdash;Pleasure Grounds, Cranbury.</p>
<p>(<i>V. Riviniana</i>).&mdash;Hursley Park.</p>
<p>(<i>V. Reichenbachiana</i>).&mdash;Dane Lane.&nbsp; The three
last are very probably only sports of <i>canina</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Cream-Coloured</span> V. (<i>V.
lactea</i>).&mdash;More skim-milk coloured, but known by
lanceolate leaves&mdash;cuckoo bushes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pansy</span> (V.
tricolor).&mdash;Everywhere in fallow fields.&nbsp; In rich soil
the upper petals become purple.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sundew</span>&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>Drosera rotundifolia</i>) The curious, hairy, dewy
leaves</p>
<p>(<i>D. intermedia</i>) and flowers that never open in full day
are to be found in the marshes near Hiltingbury.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Milkwort</span> (<i>Polygala
vulgaris</i>).&mdash;Small and blue on Otterbourne Hill, as a
stitch in the embroidery of the turf; but larger, blue, pink, or
white in the water-meadows beside the Itchen, deserving the
American name of May-wings.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Caryophylle&aelig;</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Deptford Pink</span> (<i>Dianthus
Armeria</i>).&mdash;This used to grow in a field near Highbridge,

fields.</p>

githago</i>).&mdash;The beautiful purple blossoms, set in long
graceful calyxes, adorn the paths through wheat and barley fields
everywhere.</p>

erecta</i>).&mdash;</p>

media.</i>)&mdash;The chickweed dear to bird-keepers.</p>
<p>(<i>S graminea</i>).&mdash;Cobweb-like, almost invisible
stems, and blossom with a fairy brightness over the heaths.</p>
<p>(<i>S. uliginosa</i>).&mdash;The same adapted to
marshes&mdash;Cuckoo Bushes, Helmsley.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sandwort</span> (<i>Arenaria

great winter ornament.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bloody</span> C. (<i>G.
ph&aelig;um</i>).&mdash;Ladwell Hill, where it may be a remnant
of a cottage garden.</p>

<p>(<i>E. cicutarium</i>).&mdash;Farley Mount.</p>

and trefoil leaves grows on many mossy banks, especially on one
on the Ampfield Road.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Holly</span> (<i>Ilex
Aquifolium</i>).&mdash;The glory of the peaty woods.&nbsp; The
people distinguish the berried shrubs as holly, <i>i.e.</i> holy,
those without berries being holm.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Spindle-Tree</span> (<i>Euonymus
europ&aelig;us</i>).&mdash;Also called skewer wood.&nbsp;

<p><span class="smcap">Blackthorn</span> (<i>Prunus
spinosa</i>).&mdash;It is believed that no hurt is so hard of

supposed to bring fresh cold in spring, when the bushes almost
look as if clothed by hoar-frost.</p>

Avium</i>).&mdash;The fine, tall, shapely trees put on their
bridal show in the woods of Cranbury and Ampfield.</p>

Fragariastrum</i>).&mdash;How often has &ldquo;mustn&rsquo;t pick
the strawberry blossom&rdquo; been quoted to this delusive little
white cinquefoil in early spring, when it peeps out among leaves
very like strawberry-leaves in the hedge.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Tormentil</span> (<i>P.
Tormentilla</i>).&mdash;This is now ranged among the cinquefoils,
though it has only four petals, owing perhaps to the very dry
barren heathy soil it brightens with its stars.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Cinquefoil</span> (<i>P.
repens</i>).&mdash;A smiling pentagon star by the wayside.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Silver-Weed</span> or <span
class="smcap">Goose-Grass</span> (<i>P. anserina</i>).&mdash;Why
dedicated to geese, even in Latin, it is hard to say.&nbsp;
Silver-weed is more appropriate to the silver-grey leaves that
border road-sides, sometimes with golden flowers.</p>

flower, in fruit, and, above all, in autumn foliage.</p>

c&aelig;sius</i>).&mdash;What is probably dewberry grows by the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
